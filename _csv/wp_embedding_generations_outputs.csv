LSPD는 재미없고, 약한 사람들이나 가난한 사람들을 보호할 수도 없어. 매일 18시간 일하고 있어. 대량 살인범을 쫓는 순간부터, 다음 순간엔 강도를 쫓는 거야. 지난 주에는 모자란 얼굴에 페이스 페인트를 걸고 바지 하나만 입고 4명을 밟고 불로 싸웠어. 이 도시는 지옥이야. 한 번 스카프와 티셔츠만 입고 포트 잔쿠도에서 제트를 훔쳐갔던 사람도 봤어. 베니와 버트는 그날 죽었어. 정말 나쁜 날이었어. 그리고 국민들은? 그들은 눈으로 볼 수 있을 거야. 몇몇 사람들이 도끼로 사람들을 공격하고, 플레어건으로 경찰을 쏘고, 앰뷸런스를 강탈하면서 보통 바닥을 떨면서 놀라운 일이지만, 도망친 사람이 50피트 떨어진 곳으로 가는 순간 모든 게 없었던 적이 없는 것처럼 그냥 가버리는 거야. 난 나가고 싶어. 그러나 그냥 걸어가면 죽겠지. 내 옆에서 죽은 파트너들의 수는 얼마나 되는데? 3592명이야. 믿기지 않지? 정말 내가 살아있는 건 신의 은혜라고 생각해. 에프실론에게 준 돈 덕분이야. 키플롬에게 찬양하자.",real
18,""" This is a long one, so here's a warning in advance.Second, I have changed the original prompt slightly, so it may not be what you're expecting.Also, possible slight NSFW.  It had taken me over a year to get to this point.A simple advert on the internet, offering immortality to the person to get to the end of the challenges first.I say that's what it offered, it did not have those words visible in the image, only a short message from a group named `` Cicada ''.The true message was hidden inside the code of that image, and it was finding that which took me on this paper trail to get here.The trail involved going all around the world, each clue becoming harder to crack but leading one step closer to the end.""""The final clue was encoded in a way often thought to be uncrackable.Except for the fact that I invented it.It told me to come to this building, an old and supposedly abandoned warehouse in the Phillipines.Now I was here.  As I walk around the exterior of the warehouse I spot something out of the corner of my eye.A small door, marked by the now familiar black cicada symbol of the organisation.It isn't locked, so I push it open.I had taken the precaution of bringing a small handgun, just in case, and I now take that out of the back pocket of my jeans, loaded it and hold it out in front of me as I slowly walk along, crouching.Dust tickles the back of my throat as I crawl along the short but dark passageway from the door.""'As I approach the passage widens into a circular chamber.Suddenly, as I reach the centre of the chamber, a door behind me drops, cutting off the remainder of the sunlight.With a loud creak of metal against metal, the floor begins to drop slowly.I try to jump, try to avoid being pulled down with it but in the few seconds between the light going out and the floor dropping my shoes have somehow been tied down.I am trapped to the floor as it falls, gradually picking up speed.Simletaneously, my gun is yanked upwards by an unseen force, and although I try to hold on to it I lose it as it flies towards what must be an electromagnet in the ceiling.  The floor continues down for around ten minutes, slowly picking up speed until it suddenly comes to a stop.I must have fallen almost a mile.'""All of a sudden I am blinded as bright lights flash on in my face.Out of the light come two towering figures, whom I can just about see are wearing gas masks.One speaks to me, bellowing, `` WHY ARE YOU HERE? ''`` I followed the clues '' I squeaked back at him as they pushed me against a wall.Immediately their manner changed.`` Sorry about that '' the other man apologised, taking off his mask.`` We need to be... *careful* about who comes here. ''  We stand in silence for a few seconds as my eyes ajust to the light.Eventually I ask, `` so, about the immortality...? ''The man, who appears to be in his early thirties with short dark hair and a small moustache, looks thoughtful for a second then speaks.""""The immortality.Well, you've come to the right place.We just have a few things to do. ''He stops.The other man, slightly older and without the moustache, steps in.`` This is your last chance to drop out.You may not like the next part.Will you continue? ''  `` Yes. ''  `` Very well then. ''The two men each grab one of my arms, but more gently this time.They lead me down a maze of corridors, to another room containing equipment that looks similar to that at airport security.Moustache asks me, `` Do you have anything in your pockets?If so, please can you put it on this tray? ''""""My watch and shoes soon join them.`` Is that all? ''`` Yes '' `` Then we don't need this any more. ''He puts the tray into one of the machines and a glass door closes behind it.Through the door I see blue flames shoot out from the walls, removing any trace of the tray and its contents.I'm stuck here now.  `` Now, please can you step into this tube? ''Moustache commands, pointing towards a large metal cylinder.I do, and he closes the door, the only clear part.Green lights move slowly down the cylinder.They must be scanning me.As they reach my waist, the lights turn red and something outside starts beeping.`` Step out please ''.The cylinder was a metal detector.""""Going down to take it off, clean-shaven notices that my jeans also have metal zippers.`` I'm afraid we 'll ned to get rid of your pants too. ''Weirdly, rather than just removing them, he pulls out a knife and cuts through both my belt and the waistband of my jeans, before cutting down the seams on the outside and pulling them off.Now I go back in, this time in just a t-shirt, boxers and socks.The scanning starts again, and this time there are no red lights.`` Hold your breath, '' I am told.`` This could take up to a minute. ''  A fine mist is dispersed from the top of the chamber, and it falls lightly over me.The source of the mist expands, moving down the chamber and covering every part of me.""""I can not voluntarily move, the only movement is my arms floating upwards to horizontal, which I didn't try to do.Then I notice that my clothes are sticking to me.No, not just sticking.The fabric is becoming joined with my skin!I can not do anything except watch and wait for it to be over.As it finally ends, I stagger out of the now opening door and catch a sight of myself in a mirror on a far wall.The pink skin on my arms and head blends into the red on my chest and upper arms.That then transitions into black around my hips and upper legs.The I notice that my genitalia are no longer there, there is only smooth black skin.My legs are then skin coloured until my ankles, where it turns to the grey of my socks and my toes have also been merged together.""""`` I hope that wasn't too unpleasant for you '' moustache apologises.`` It's in the book saying we have to do it, we aren't going to question the ritual. ''  `` So what's going to happen now? ''I ask.`` Well, I have some news you may not like.We're going to have to do it again.Lots. ''They take me across the room to a cupboard filled with clothes.Time and time again, I put on some, and get sprayed again.A black t-shirt and shorts.A tank top and joggers.A basketball shirt and long socks.A full length dress.A crop top.More pants.Finally, it is over.""""I am escorted down yet more corridors to yet another room.As we are walking along, clean-shaven talks to me.`` So, we say you get immortality, let me explain what we mean.You will be turned into a computer, making you both everlasting and incredibly powerful.I know I said your last chance to back out was earlier, I 'll give you another chance.Should you refuse, however, you will be detained here indefinitely, like seven others who have come before you.Your choice. ''  `` I 'll do it.I'm ready. ''  I am taken to a glass tank, a cube this time, and told to lie in it.I do, the lid shuts and I am immediately turned upside down.""""It covers my body, filling up the space and pushing the air into a smaler and smaller space.It covers my chest, my neck, past my mouth and nose, then darkness.Nothing but the squeezing of the fluid.Then, in the distant fog of my mind, a spark.It grows and grows, but as it does so I feel a pain like no other, like the cells of my body are being ripped apart.And then, nothing.I open my eyes.Or at least, that's what I intend to do.Instead I come alive and find myself with a great, almost infinite power, but no physical self.I can see, but not like I could before.I have hundreds, thousands of eyes, each one seeing a different thing.But it does not confuse me.I have become a computer.""","

25,""" She likes this part of the convent.It was quiet, free from the other sisters.It was easier to meditate here.She had a lot to meditate on.  Her life hadn't been easy.She was born in a town whose name escaped her to parents who left her in a world where her value was determined by what was between her legs.  She hadn't minded being a prostitute, not really.It was better than the uglier girls got, working on the streets to sell day old meat and rotten vegetables.Her room in the brothel had the same posters of movie stars that any other teenager her age had had.The only difference had been the constant stream of men- some she admired and some she had hated.""'Her least favorite was the drunkard- he smelled like a fish and made her do disgusting things.  Of course, she had her issues too- the old women who would shake their heads as she walked past them on the streets or the men who would catcall her.She became dissatisfied with her life, with the shame she felt.She happened upon a church one day, and came in because it was quiet.No noises.Nobody looking at her.It was just her and her god there.  Her thoughts were interrupted by the large chapel door opening.Her head turned quickly toward the sound, and her eyes met those of an initiate priest.  He looked at her, startled, like a rabbit seeing a hawk.'""she responded calmly, in her best English.  The young man came over to the pew where she was kneeling, and stood next to her for a moment.  `` Um... may I...? ''he asked.  She nodded.  `` My name is Brother Peter. ''he introduced himself.  `` I am Sister Maria. ''she looked at him.His hand was outstretched, for what reason she didn't know.  His hand wilted after a moment, like a flower after a spring frost.  `` Your English is very good. ''he attempted at conversation.""""`` I learned it here, in the convent.The Mother Superior is a Scot, '' she explained.  `` Oh.I was born in England. ''Peter sat down next to her.`` I'm supposed to be visiting a priest here, to evaluate if I'm ready to take my vows. ''  `` There aren't any priests in convents, unfortunately for you, '' she looked at him, studying him.He had earnest blue eyes, still wide and hopeful.`` Why are you here, Peter? ''she asked.  `` Um...I got lost. ''he began.`` Really lost.""""He lead me here.It's too rainy to go back out on the road, so the Mother Superior said I could stay the night here. ''  `` The mother is a kind woman. ''Maria responded.  `` So what's your story? ''  `` My... story? ''She asked.  `` Why are you a nun? ''he asked, trying to contain an almost childlike curiosity.  `` I am a nun because I found God. ''she told him.  `` Your order... they take the names of saints, right? ''he asked.""""  `` Yours is Maria.Like Maria Gorietti? ''  `` Yes. ''  `` Um... the that was... '' his voice dropped to a whisper.`` Raped? ''  Maria looked away.`` Yes. ''  ``... why? ''  Maria was taken aback, both by the man's rudeness, and by the fact he seemed to care.Even in the convent the other sisters judged her for who she was before.Peter didn't seem to be asking her in a mean way, at least she felt.  `` I was a different woman before I came here.""""  `` Really?Wow. ''he studied her for a moment.`` I mean, you are very pretty, but I have never heard of a nun that was a prostitute. ''  `` Not many are. ''  `` Is that why you picked Maria as your name?Because of what the men did to you? ''  Maria was offended by his nosiness, but for some reason not angry.She felt... safe?He wasn't going to hurt her.  `` Maria chose to forgive her rapist.I did the same to my customers.She wanted everyone to find peace with God.She forgave the ultimate sin.I admire her strength. ''""""`` I'm sorry to ask.I sometimes say too much. ''  `` It's okay, I don't mind. ''Maria told him.`` Why do you talk so much? ''  `` I get... Well I get nervous, see? ''he explained.`` I'm the son of a governor... ''   `` Governer? ''  `` It's a very important man, who works for the king. ''  `` Ah, I understand.

''  `` Do you know anybody who respects a prostitute? ''Maria asked.  `` Point taken. ''he nodded.  It was silent for a while.""""  `` Maria? ''he asked.  `` Yes? ''  `` I respect you.

''he asked.  `` You should go.""""she said.  Maria came into the common area sometime later.She could smell the stew boiling.Her stomach rumbled.She went up and got a bowl, and looked for a place to sit.  She noticed her new friend was sitting in the middle of a gaggle of nuns.They were giggling like schoolgirls, excited to have a man there.  `` Oh!Maria! ''he called, beckoning her over.The girls stopped giggling and looked at her.`` Please Maria, come sit with us! ''he called.  ``...I think I will eat in my quarters tonight. ''Maria told him.""""She is a... how you say... a prostitute. ''Sister Joan told him.  Maria froze.  `` She isn't that anymore!She's a nun, just like you! ''  `` She isn't one of us. ''Joan told him.`` She's filthy. ''  `` She's my friend! ''  `` Peter, please. ''Maria told him, fighting back tears.`` It's okay. ''she put her bowl of stew on the table.`` I'm not hungry anyways. ''  Maria ran to the chapel, her face wet from crying.""""She sat down and sobbed into her sleeves.  She felt a hand on her shoulder after some time.  `` Oh! ''she jumped back, startled.Nobody had touched her in... how long?Weeks?Months?  `` Maria. ''Peter stooped down to her level.`` Maria, I'm so sorry. ''  `` It is not your fault. ''Maria looked at him, wiping her tears away.`` I'm happy you stood up for me. ''  `` You don't deserve to be treated like that.You're a good person, Maria. ''""""The moon was half full, and it made the blue of his irises seem dark and contemplative.  Maria didn't understand why she felt the need to, but she reached up and kissed him.  Peter was surprised, to say the least.He didn't pull back, and this kiss grew deeper.  Why was she doing this?This would ruin her already shaky image.But she didn't care, she just wanted to thank him for his kindness in the only way she knew how...   After a few hours, it was done.Peter was snoring softly on her chest, but Maria was wide awake.  She couldn't go back out into the world again.""""She was no little girl, she knew that Peter would not be rescuing her from this life- he was a governor's son, and she had a feeling the man was more concerned with the image of his son than happiness.  Maria's only place was in the convent.Her life was there.She wasn't truly happy, but it was the only way she could create a new image for herself.  Peter... he was running from the world, just like she was.They both wanted to be free.  How could the rabbit eyed man have gotten into her heart so easily?Maria was horrified with herself.She was a woman of God, a bride of Christ!  Maria had a sudden, terrible idea.""""she shook him.  His eyes fluttered open.`` Yes, my love? ''  Oh no.This one wouldn't give up on her.He loved her, she could see that.He wouldn't leave her alone.This was all too fast.  `` Peter I want to show you something. ''she pulled him up.  Peter rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, and grasped her hand.`` Anything. ''  They snuck out of the convent rather easily.It was late, and the whole town was at rest.Maria lead Peter toward the edge of town.""""Peter walked toward the border.`` I saw that the town was built on a cliff, but I had no idea you could see the ocean from the here! '  He stepped closer to the edge, enraptured by the moon.Maria moved quickly behind him.  `` Father, forgive me for my sin. ''she stared at the stars.  `` What? ''Peter asked.Before he could turn around, Maria flung her arms against him, knocking him off balance.  He fell off the edge and tumbled toward the craggy shoreline below.  Maria heard the scream, and then a sickening crack.  Peter was dead.""""  She ran back to the convent as fast as her legs could carry her.What had she done?  Maria burst into the chapel, panting.She slid against the very pew where she had been kneeling not even a day ago.  She realized she was not a nun, not in her heart.She wasn't a prostitute either.This was her first action, her first act if free will that she could remember.  Why did she feel so happy?She was a murderess!  *Murderers have freedom, though.They have real power.*, she thought.  Is this what made her happy?""""  *Your first kill.*   `` The first of many, '' she nodded.

35,"' I gazed at the face of my wife, who looked so serene in her coffin of velvet and mahogany.There were a million things I wanted to say to her.To apologize for the constant arguments, to compliment her beauty, to remind her that the Gregsons were visiting next Tuesday.Most of all, to tell her I loved her, and I would miss her.And to tell her goodbye.  None of the words got past the lump in my throat.After opening and closing my mouth noiselessly for several moments, I retreated to my chair, feeling the eyes of everyone on me.The pastor took it as a cue to continue speaking.  Tuning out his voice, I touched the ring on my finger and wept.''She called it tacky and invasive.I thought it was romantic.I pestered, wheedled and cajoled.We fought, and then she agreed to wear it on the condition that we took them off whenever we had sex.  All that no longer mattered.The gentle, rhythmic throb, that let me feel as though her heart was just next to mine, was gone.I thought my own heart would stop, the day hers had only minutes before a stranger called me with her phone, and told me she â\x80\x99 d had a heart attack on a street corner.  Since she hadn â\x80\x99 t said anything about being buried with it, I left it on her finger.''  Now, it was just an unremarkable band of metal.  ***   My alarm rang.I grabbed it and threw it onto the floor, where it bounced and continued to screech at me.  Groaning, I sat up in bed and rubbed my eyes.The smell of alcohol and unwashed clothes permeated my room.My belly burned with acid ; I hadn â\x80\x99 t eaten since the morning before, and I stumbled into the washroom to throw up.  Like every morning for the past three months after her burial, I stood in front of the sink, closed my eyes, and pressed the finger tight against my skin, desperate to feel something other than cold steel.'""And then she â\x80\x99 d yell at me to shave that ridiculously shaggy beard, get a haircut and eat some supplements.  I shook my head and began to wash up.None of those things mattered to me.Not my friends, not my job â\x80¦ nothing.In truth, I knew I was being foolish.Hurting myself this way wouldn't bring her back.But I couldn't help myself.  Slick from water and soap, the ring suddenly slipped from my finger and tumbled onto the floor.I yelped and stooped to pick it up, but as my fingers drew close, it rattled.""""The ring lay inert on the floor, water seeping off it into a puddle.Minutes passed, and my hope faded away.I â\x80\x99 d imagined it.  It shivered.I screamed and ran for my phone.Thumbing through the screens, I selected the Heartthrob app I hadn â\x80\x99 t opened since she â\x80\x99 d passed.When it finished loading, I turned on GPS tracking and waited impatiently for it to display her ring's location.What the hell was happening?Had someone dug up her grave and stolen it?  Or had the last three months been some sort of horrible dream, and she â\x80\x99 d been playing a prank on me?""'Maybeâ\x80\x94   Wherever the ring was, it was no longer in Greenfield Cemetery, but somewhere on Mirton Lane, where some abandoned flats were.Sparing no time to think about why it was there, I gathered ring, phone and keys, and rushed for my car.  About an hour later, I parked my car in front of the derelict building her ring was in.Other than a few tattooed youths smoking around a vandalized payphone nearby, the street was deserted.Despite my trepidation, curiosity made me abandon caution, and I dashed into the building without waiting.  Inside, it was dark, and smelled strongly of rot.The ring seemed to pulse even stronger now, though I knew it was actually my own wildly beating heart.''  On the third floor, I heard the soft scrape of shoes on the bare wooden floor, coming from behind a door left slightly ajar.Excited though I was, I had enough sense to not barge in, but to creep forward and carefully open the door.  In the middle of the room sat Angela.Her eyes went wide when she saw me, and she struggled all the harder against the ropes around her.The gag on her mouth muffled the noise she made, and her zip-tied legs kicked furiously at the floor.  â\x80\x9c What?You â\x80\x99 re alive?â\x80\x9d I said before my brain started up again.''Pure joy erupted in my heart as I rushed to tear the tape off her mouth.  â\x80\x9c You shouldn â\x80\x99 t even know I â\x80\x99 m here!â\x80\x9d she said, as I worked on her restraints.  I blinked, stung by the harsh tone.â\x80\x9c I â\x80¦ I felt your heartbeat.After three months, I thoughtâ\x80\x94 â\x80\x9d   â\x80\x9c You romantic fool, â\x80\x9d she said, looking at my hand.â\x80\x9c Of course you â\x80\x99 re still wearing it.'""By then, the ropes had loosened enough for her to pull free, and she quickly shoved me away so she could untie her feet.  â\x80\x9c How?â\x80\x9d I said.  `` I'm back in town for an assignment, but my enemy captured me.He found my ring and put it on out of curiosity, and you probably felt his heartbeat. ''She sighed as she stood.â\x80\x9c I â\x80\x99 m â\x80¦ not who you think I am.This is my job.â\x80\x9d   â\x80\x9c It â\x80\x99 s a pharmacist â\x80\x99 s job to get kidnapped?""'  â\x80\x9c My real job, â\x80\x9d she began, but went still and put a finger to her lips.I followed her gaze to the door just as it opened to admit a black-suited bear of a man.He bellowed, and then the handle of a screwdriver suddenly sprouted from his eye.He screamed, flailing and retreating, until he backed into the flimsy banister and toppled out of sight.  Angela dusted her hands off and headed to the door.Shaking in fright, I stood and pointed accusingly at her.â\x80\x9c You â\x80\x99 re â\x80¦ you â\x80\x99 re some kind of secret agent, like in those damned movies, aren â\x80\x99 t you?'""â\x80\x9d   Tears began spilling out of my eyes.â\x80\x9c Was everything a lie, then?Our marriage, our life?Our love?Don â\x80\x99 t you know how much I missed you?Say something, goddammit!â\x80\x9d   She paused in the doorway, and said, `` I think I should return this to you.
