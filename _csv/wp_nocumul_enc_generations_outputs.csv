나는 절대 와인을 즐기지 않았어. 항상 썩어버린 냄새가 나는 것 같았어... 그래서 저는 손을 씻을 때 물이 와인으로 바뀌는 걸 발견했는데, 처음에는 놀랐지만 그 기쁨은 사라졌어. 이제 물을 씻을 때 밖에 씻어야 하거나 썩은 포도주로 씻게 될 거라는 거야. 그래서 나는 늦게까지 이건 얼마나 큰 선물인지 알았어. 나는 새로 씻은 싱크대에 물을 따라 바르고 있었는데, 물이 다 와인으로 바뀌기 전까지 계속 씻고 있었어. 그리고 측정 컵으로 와인을 스코프해서 병에 담았어. 와인에 대해 잘 알고 있는 친구한테 맛 보내봤는데, 집에서 연구한 와인이라고 해서 맛 보냈더라고. 그는 한 모금 마셔보고 좋아했어. 그래서 나는 첫 단계를 시작했어. 

플러머는 나가 미친 줄 알았지만, 고객이 항상 맞다고 하는거지. 나는 배수를 끊고 병 봉투기로 연결했어. 초기 비용은 상당히 비싸지만, 그건 상관 없었어. 일반적인 와인 제조소에서 말하는 것보다 훨씬 적은 양을 팔아도 손익분기점을 넘길 수 있었거든. 나는 유일한 운영 비용이 물이었지. 몇 주 뒤에 많은 양의 병이 모인 걸 보았어. 일요일 시장에 표를 예약해서 병을 팔았어. 첫 주에 반을 돌려받고, 네 번째 주부터 이익을 내기 시작했어.

30,"' I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate actually, who was always talking about his family.His name was Robert Gooding, and he must â\x80\x99 ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve.Every single day he would drone on and on about what some of his cousins, named Nate and Riley, were doing in Russia that month to help the poor there or how Dimitri, his mother â\x80\x99 s grandfather â\x80\x99 s nephew â\x80\x99 s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, was going to be the next star athlete in Greece.I was always patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories.They never seemed to be about the same people.''Poor old rambling Robert, a nickname he picked up within a couple weeks of starting school, didn â\x80\x99 t make many friends because he would never stop talking about his own family.Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn â\x80\x99 t start running after five minutes.I â\x80\x99 m not going to lie, back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings, but no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me about his family â\x80\x99 s latest adventures.  I only remember once, on a day close to the end of our first semester together, when he stopped his rambling and looked at me with a really serious expression.''â\x80\x9c You know Michael, â\x80\x9d he started as I prepared my apology, â\x80\x9c I really appreciate that you listen to all my stories every day.I know that it must be boring and annoying for you, but you do it anyway and I appreciate that.I feel like we â\x80\x99 ve really got a connection going here so I â\x80\x99 ll tell you something.Us Goodings, we don â\x80\x99 t forget stuff like this.We pay our debts.Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.â\x80\x9d I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.''Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when Robert decided to transfer out to some college in Washington.I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while.I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown.I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels.It was there that I finally met one of Rambling Robert â\x80\x99 s infamous family members, Randall Gooding.He was my supervisor there, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend.He told me that he recognized my name from the stories Robert had told him and personally requested that I be sent down.''Randall was just as talkative as my roommate was, and we hit it off almost as well as I did with Robert.His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy which had me chuckling for at least a day remembering all of Robert â\x80\x99 s old stories.Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine.He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.  Work was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically.Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work.Even Randy wasn â\x80\x99 t as talkative around this time.It was all supposed to come to a head today.''Our sting agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the sting operation.We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.  From the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me.They were careful.All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right.All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons.Only two of them had guns, but the rest were carrying various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars.The night was rough.''I was patient and waited.I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it.While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings.I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building.I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me.I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.  However, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance.*Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped*, I thought.''I noticed that some of them now carried automatic weapons.I hadn â\x80\x99 t seen those last night.One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held.After cracking me in the face with the butt of the weapon, I felt more than heard him raise the gun level with the back of my head.I heard Randy â\x80\x99 s voice over the megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up.Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip.Randy â\x80\x99 s voice came over the megaphone with a message for me before he continued the negotiation, â\x80\x9c Mikey!Just wait Mikey!Hold on and don â\x80\x99 t do anything stupid.''If it weren â\x80\x99 t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out.Eventually things got quiet.My guard walked out probably to check for new orders with his superiors.As soon as he left the room, the sound of a hundred shattered glass windows broke the silence raining shards of glass like snow down on the main factory floor.Then it looked like every bit of dust in the old factory flew up all at once as tear gas flooded the facility.The shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire.Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn â\x80\x99 t tell who was winning.I did hear Randy â\x80\x99 s voice at one point yelling orders, â\x80\x9c Dimitri, take the stairs and give Nate some cover.''The din began to wither after only a few minutes and the unseen officers in the facility began yelling, â\x80\x9c Clear!â\x80\x9d As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today â\x80\x99 s operation.Instead I saw lots of men I had never seen before in various uniforms.Some of them were in army uniforms others were in suits, and a few were in civilian clothes.*God did they call the Army and CIA in on this?* I located Randy and he came running up with one of the suited men carrying a bag after I yelled.  â\x80\x9c Michael!Thank God you â\x80\x99 re still alive.''â\x80\x9d   â\x80\x9c What?What flights?Randy what are you talking about?â\x80\x9d   â\x80\x9c We found out you were kidnapped at about midnight.The team that we were going to use wasn â\x80\x99 t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise.I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here.Good thing cousin Billy happened to have hostage experience.Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.â\x80\x9d   I looked to my left at the man in the suit who had been carrying the bag that I now saw contained medical supplies.â\x80\x9c Robert?''He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work.â\x80\x9c You mean to tell me that all of those guys down thereâ\x80¦ They â\x80\x99 re all your family?â\x80\x9d   Robert looked up from where he was examining my jaw where my last assailant hit me with a wry smile, â\x80\x9c I told you we don â\x80\x99 t forget Mike.All the Goodings come to those who wait.â\x80\x9d'","

""엄마."" 그의 입술이 작은 미소로 움직였고, 그는 뒤죽박죽한 머리카락을 손으로 거리며. 죽기 전까지도 그것은 바뀌지 않았다. ""알아, 나는 너가 그 약을 먹을 가지가 없다고 생각했어. 너는 항상 그것에 반대했잖아."" ""넌 내 아들이야,"" 나는 강하게 말했다. ""내가 너를 위해 뭐든 할 수 있어."" 그의 미소는 사라졌다. ""너는 더 이상 할 필요가 없어,"" 그의 말이 나를 충격으로 떨게 했고, 나는 그가 말하는 것을 왜 나는 그렇게 강하게 반대했던 약을 사용하고 있는지를 생각했다. 그리고 그가 밑에 베개 아래에 숨겨 놓은 빈 약병을 생각했고, 그리고 그가 얼마나 희미하고 차가운 손이었는지, 그리고 그의 랩톱이 여전히 켜져 있고, 빈 단어 문서로 열려 있는 것을 생각했다. ""왜 나는 자살했는지 말해줘,"" 나는 숨을 가다듬었다. ""왜야?"" 그는 내 말로 놀라고 당황하는 듯했다. ""엄마, 난... 난 이제 설명할 수 없어. 제발. "" ""찰리,"" 나는 감정을 억제하려고 노력했다. ""찰리, 제발."" 그의 얼굴은 가면으로 변하고, 그의 초록 눈 - 그가 남겨 둔 유일한 색깔 - 가 가라앉았다. ""엄마, 내가 왜 자살했는지 너에게 말해줄게."" 그의 말이 나를 충격으로 떨게 했고, 나는 그가 왜 그렇게 했는지를 생각했다. ""네가 있었어.""",real
