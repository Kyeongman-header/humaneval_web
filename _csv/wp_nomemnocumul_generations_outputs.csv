나는 너무나 죄송합니다. 내가 이렇게 해야하는 걸 미워합니다. 이렇게 하게 되었는데 세상은 악한 사람들과 악한 거짓말로 가득하고, 나는 그들을 물리칠 방법이 없다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 그들을 물리치기 위해서는 내가 할 수 있는 건 무기력한 사람들에게 불행한 결과를 완화하기 위해 내 작정을 하는 것 뿐입니다. 참으로 끔찍한 이야기가 퍼져나가고 있고, 나는 그런 이야기를 만든 사람들과 거짓말들이 동등한 악당이라는 것을 느끼지 못하지 않았습니다.

오늘 아침 나는 침대에서 나가기를 두려워했습니다. 내 배가 아팠고, 몸이 아프기도 했습니다. 오늘은 모든 것을 취소하고 침대에 누워 아내를 안고 있겠다고 생각했습니다. 롭과 디 디와 함께 끔찍하게 색깔로 물든 어린이 드라마를 보고 의사가 나에게 건강하게 식사하라고 하는 대로 중국 음식을 먹겠다고 생각했습니다. 그리고 배가 아프면 차를 마시겠다고 생각했고, 오늘은 정장을 입지 않겠다고 생각했습니다. 그러나 침대에서 느릿느릿 밖으로 빠져나가는 것을 보며 생각했습니다. 정말 이 정장을 싫어합니다. 이런 옷을 입고 죽는 것 같습니다. 옷을 입고 보니 내가 몸무게를 조금 증가시켰다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 그랬더니 참을 수 없이 쉿 나왔습니다. 정말 나는 더 잘 건강하게 잘 챙겨야 할 것 같습니다. 나는 아직 나이가 젊습니다. 나와 같은 나이의 남자들은 여전히 스포츠를 하고 달리기도 합니다. 오늘은 취소하고 달리기를 하는 것도 좋겠지만, 시간이 없습니다. 어린 아이처럼 놀면서 시간을 낭비하면 안 됩니다. 내일이면 늦습니다.

나는 집을 나갔습니다. 집을 나간 지 일시간 전에 조앤이를 보았는데 걱정하고 있는 것 같았습니다. 요즘 나는 걱정하고 있는 것 같습니다. 우리가 살고 있는 세상은 두려운 세상이기도 합니다. 나는 조앤이가 걱정하지 않기를 바랍니다. 나는 더 적게 중국 음식을 먹고 싸우고 더 많이 달리고 조앤을 사랑하는 것이 좋았을 것 같습니다. 그것은 오직 스트레스 때문이었습니다. 그녀는 나가 있어야 할 때마다 나를 지지해줍니다. 나는 그녀를 사랑하고 알고 있습니다. 그리고 여기 일하는 곳에 왔습니다. 여기에는 사람들이 모여 있고, 나는 그들에게 일을 나눠주고 말해야 합니다. 네, 여기에는 악당들도 있지만, 그들은 이 사람들이 아닙니다. 나에게 행운이 있었다면, 그들은 시스템의 병든 부분을 밝혀내고 악을 물리치는 첫 번째 도구가 될 것입니다. 이것은 나를 돌볼 수 없는 전투입니다. 나는 돌아가지 않겠습니다.

나는 조앤이를 많이 사랑합니다. 우리는 싸움을 너무 많이 합니다. 나는 중국 음식을 먹고 싸우는 대신 달리고 조앤을 사랑하는 것이 좋았을 것 같습니다. 그러나 그것은 스트레스 때문이었습니다. 그녀는 나가 있어야 할 때마다",real

The first time he told me about it, I thought it was some kind of joke.He had always been one of the most interesting people in the kingdom, and never unfairly burden anyone with his secrets.The last time he said anything to me was when we were young.We used to be friends, but now we are enemies.I think that is why our family has decided to move away from the castle.It's not really what they wanted us to do, though.They didn't want us to leave any trace of ourselves on the land.That would have been too much for them to handle.But then again, who cares?"""" â\x80\x99 s name is James, and I am the first to tell you that.

I had no idea how it all started, but there was really one reason anyone wants to know.The dragons were very powerful and they did not have any control over their own lives.They even kept large predators that could kill an entire dragon with a single blow.It wasn't until my grandfather died that I realized he would never be able to see me again.He told me of his great-great-grandfather, who gave birth to him as a child when he was just 14.His grandpa passed away shortly after we found out about his father's death.I don't know why, but I knew at the time that he was going to die soon.""' â\x80\x99 s father had been a dragon for centuries, and he was the last one alive.

The last time I saw my father, he was dead.I don't know how long it took for me to figure out what caused him to die, but there was really one reason anyone wants to be buried alive : He was an old man who died trying to save the world from its greatest threat.He did not want to risk being killed by another dragon, so I decided to take care of him."""" â\x80\x99 s the reason why I am here. The first time I saw a dragon, it was just in my dreams.It looked like an old man with long black hair and dark eyes.I could tell he had some kind of scar on his face.The next time I visited him, he seemed to be trying to make me feel better.He even kept large predators at bay.When I asked what they were doing, he told me that they were searching for us.They said we were going to find them.But then one day, after several days of searching, I came across this note.`` What are you looking for? ''I asked."""" â\x80\x99 s father told me that it was because of the dragons.I had never heard of a dragon before, but I knew he was right. The man said that there were no dragons left in the world.There were only two humans left on this planet.The one with the sword and the other with the spear.They could not find anything else to keep them at bay.It was as if every single noble family had been destroyed by some unknown force or another.If they found something, they would be punished for their actions.That is what happened when the last dragon came into existence.We didn't know where it came from, so we just assumed it was an ancient cave.""' â\x80\x99 s father had told him that the dragon was a threat to every single noble family in the kingdom, and even kept large predators on their backs. The dragons were more than willing to do anything to keep them away from any one other person.Even if they did try to take advantage of it, they would never unfairly burden anyone with such an issue.The only way to prevent this kind of behavior is to find out what happened next.If you are lucky enough to be able to kill a dragon, then you will not have to worry about getting killed by another dragon.As for me, I am just as concerned about my own safety as everyone else.'' â\x80\x99 s name is Sam, and you can call me Sam if you want. I was born on the day of my birth, in a small village in the middle of the forest.I had never heard of this place before, but it seemed to have been abandoned by every single noble family that lived there.There were no more dragons around, just buildings burning around them.My father told me that when he came back from his travels, he wanted to see what would happen next.He said that we should be able to find out for sure how long until they found us.It seems as though most of the people who live here are either dead or missing.The only thing keeping them alive is their own bodies.'' â\x80\x99 s name is James, after all.'","

The room was a large circle -- a cylinder, for all the pedants out there -- with a diameter of probably 25 feet.The walls were made of the same material as whatever I had just been laying on, and seemed to breathe with a dull, fluorescent glow.Above and below me, white circles of tile formed both the floor and ceiling.Thinking back now, it seems unfair to call the tiles `` tiles '', and not call the metallic surfaces `` metal '', but I'm trying to describe it in terms you 'll understand.""""Anyway...

앗, 나 정말 마약을 먹었나 봐. 앞으로 나는 이불 위에서 자는 걸 생각했었는데, 이건 저녁 액티비티의 표준 일이었어. 그런데 잠에서 깨어나서 눈을 비비면 더 강렬한 현실이 나타났어. 나는 차가운 금속처럼 느껴지는 표면에 누워 있었어. 그걸 침대라고 부르기는 어려웠지만, 이불과도 같지 않았어. 침대는 따뜻한 걸 다 알고 있잖아. 그리고 나가 누워있던 그 것은 만지면 차가웠어. 천장에서 나를 바라보는 램프가 나를 밝은 파란 빛으로 비추고 있었어. 미간이 좀 어지러워도 몸이 떨려 나가는 걸 멈추지 못하고 그곳에서 멀리 나갔어. 빛의 원 안에서 벗어나면 더 자세히 주변을 살펴볼 수 있었어. 그리고 그 방은 큰 원형이었어. 사실 원통이었지만, 그걸 이해할 수 있는 단어로 표현하기는 어려웠어. 벽은 나가 누워있던 그 것과 같은 물질로 되어 있었고, 불규칙한 방사 빛이 내뿜고 있었어. 위아래로 흰 타일로 된 바닥과 천장이 있었어. 이제 생각해보면 타일이라고 부르기가 부적절한 거 같고, 금속 면을 금속이라고 부르기도 부적절한 거 같아. 그런데 너무 이해할 수 있는 단어로 표현하려고 하거든. 그래서 내가 그 벽 한 면에 손을 대면 큰 화살표가 나타났고, 붉은 빛으로 나를 공격해왔어. 나는 물러났고, 모든 벽에 같은 화살표가 나타났어. 그걸 따라가면 반투명해지고 나는 바깥에서 어떤 종류의 생명체들이 돌아다니는 걸 볼 수 있었어. 그걸 통과할 수 있는 길이 열리기를 기대하고 그걸 따라갔는데, 그게 열리지 않아서 멈추고 말았어. 아마 센서가 고장났나 봐. 식료품 점에서 자동 문을 보면 자동 문 센서는 신뢰할 수 없다는 걸 배웠지. 그래서 거기서 `` 네가 그걸 걷어나갈 수 있어. 그건 물 같은 느낌이 나. 두려워하지 마.

I tried to find a way to stop it, but no matter how hard I tried, every hero eventually gave up on me.It didn't take long for me to figure out that if I could just kill myself, I would be able to go back and save them all.But then again, what do you have to do when you can only use your own power?That's one of the reasons why I can't really create great good in this world anymore."""" â\x80\x99 s power is a potential fatal power, which can be used to save lives.I have seen multiple showdowns throughout my time as a hero, but nothing much ever happened in the last few years. I had managed to get him to give me his powers, and he was very happy with it.He told me that he would use them for good, and that there were many people who could use them against him.It wasn't until after this incident that I realized that if I gave him what he wanted, he would end up being able to do anything at all.In fact, when I first met him, he did not even look like one of those heroes you see on TV.Instead, he looked like a young villain slowly crept behind an old man's back.""""'s face was covered in blood, and his eyes were red. `` What do you want from me? ''I asked him.He looked at me with a look of concern on his face.`` I just want to make sure it doesn't get out of hand. ''The villain slowly crept behind the man, grabbing my arm and pulling me towards him.It was then that I realized what he was doing.Just as I was about to pull away, an image appeared before me.A picture of a young girl standing in front of me.Her hair was cut short, and her eyes were sunken into them.She had been wearing a black dress for some time now, but she didn't seem to have any other clothes on.""""'s face was a mixture of confusion and horror. `` No, I don't want to die! ''The villain said as he pulled out his phone from his pocket.`` It's just...I can't believe this is going to be the first time we've seen multiple showdowns throughout my life. ''"""," 잠에서 깨어나는 것은 놀랍게도 내가 살아온 시간동안 많은 전투를 보았지만 나에게는 아무것도 일어나지 않았다는 것이었다. 나는 모르겠었다. 나가 침대에서 나왔는지 얼마나 지났는지, 나는 더 이상 잠들 수 있을까 하는 것이었다. 그러나 내 눈을 다시 열었을 때, 그 앞에는 늙은 남자가 서 있었다. 그는 울고 있는 것 같았다. 그의 얼굴은 희미하고 그의 머리는 그의 이마에 붉은 피가 가득해 있었다. 그 뒤에는 젊은 악당이 속삭임 속에서 나를 바라보고 있었다. ""너는 괜찮아?"" 그는 부드럽게 물었다.",fake
