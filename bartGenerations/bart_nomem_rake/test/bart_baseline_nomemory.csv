I am twenty-three years old, a young officer number forty-five. I have just witnessed Willie shrivel and die in front of my eyes. It is hard to believe that he was only fourteen when he died. But then again, how could it be otherwise? He was the last person I ever wanted to see alive. And yet here I am, standing on the sidewalk with flashing red lights mirroring my every move. My Converse sneakers take up most of my feet as I rest cluelessly think about what will happen next. A new law telling everyone they can do whatever they want. The exact opposite actually. As if adding legal rights to our lives would somehow make us any better than we were before. There is a fine yet blurred line between right and wrong. Meaning ethically wrong. TheTears relentlessly plunging down my cheeks. Hey dad...
	Yes?You dont need to worry about me anymore. I know you love me more than anything else. Thats why I made this promise.Dear Eden, I miss you so very much.. I and the new law telling everyone that they have created legal rights by adding legal rights to themselves. It is a fine yet blurred line between meaning ethically wrong and doing something morally wrong. The exact opposite actually. We all want what we think is right for our own self-interest. But it is not always right. Some days are harder than others. There are times when your mind just won't let you go. You rest cluelessly think that things will be okay. And then there are those days where you feel like everything has been ripped away from you. Those days when you can no longer put yourself through school or work without some sort of mental damage breaking into your body. When you wonder if you're ever going to get out of here. . s voice echoes in my head. You dont need to worry about me, Ill take care of you. Promise.
Dear Eddie, I promise. My heart aches as I listen to him tell me his story. How he witnessed Willie shrivel up before his very eyes. He watched her cry so hard she could barely breathe. He saw her fall to the ground sobbing uncontrollably. I*   *What am I supposed to do with this new law telling everyone that they have a right to be happy? Why can't I just go home and hug my wife for all I know? *   The sun is beginning to set over the horizon when I hear it. A loud thud on the door makes me jump out of my skin. It must be coming from inside the house. When I open the door, there are two men standing at the doorway. They look like they were expecting me. Their faces are covered in sweat but their smiles are genuine. One of them wears a white t-shirt while the other has a black T-shirt under his sweatshirt. His hands are tied behind his back. There is no way. s eyes spilling happiness. Hey dad...
	Yes?
	He leans against the side of the car as he listens to her giggle circling around him. She giggles because she knows what will happen if she doesnt. He laughs because he knows how much she loves him. And even though he hates her too, he still loves her more than anything else. But something is wrong.. I look at my feet and realize I am wearing a pair of Converse sneakers take after me. My legs are wobbly from walking for so long. They feel like they are going somewhere else. I don't know where but I do know that it's not here anymore. It's gone. I'm sitting in front of the flashing red lights mirror with tears relentlessly plunging into my eyes. I have no choice but to stand up and walk out of this house. The only thing keeping me upright is the burning sunbeams sucking all the life out of me. I sit down on the edge of the bed and stare at the ceiling. . 
 
	My hands tremble as I grip the steering wheel. Dont worry dad, well be fine. Were just trying to figure out how to get home safely.
Thats what you always say when you ask something wrong. You never want to find yourself in an uncomfortable situation again. Just try to focus on your work instead of worrying about whether or not you can make it home okay? His voice is raspy and. I look at him with tears relentlessly plunging into my eyes spilling happiness over his face. He looks up at me like he wants to hug me but doesn't because he doesn't know if I'm going to do it anyway. It's too late for that right now. My feet are throbbing from all the running so I sit down next to him and rest cluelessly think about our future together. A new law telling everyone they have created legal rights has been passed adding legal rights to every human being. The exact opposite actually. Legal rights only apply to those who don't already have them. This is a fine yet blurred line between good and evil. ",,fake
1,"    Alright Frank, this is going to be interesting    I was laying on the soft leather couch beside my father. My eyes shot open as he walked over to me.  What are you doing here?  He asked with a concerned look on his face.  You know what dad, it  s time for us to get out of here and go back to our lives!  I said while pushing myself up from the couch. As soon as I stood up, my father started walking back into the living room. His hands were shaking as he approached me. There was something wrong there was blood everywhere but more importantly, there was no sign of my little brother  Are you alright son? I can still hear him yelling Yelling at me, screaming in my head Then one Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Eleven Twelve 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35.     Alright Frank, let  s get started.    Dr. Miller sat down on the soft leather couch beside me.  So what do you want to know?  He asked. I looked up at him and he was staring at me with a blank expression on his face. His eyes shot open as if he had seen something wrong but nothing came out of his mouth. After a few seconds of silence, he said :  Well, it seems that we will be able to live forever  The room went silent for a moment. My father starts walking back into the living room. There was blood everywhere What happened? Why is there blood everywhere? Who killed my little brother  Dad! Daddy!. He looks at me expectantly, waiting for me to say something.  Whatever makes you feel like this.. 
 
 Do you remember your earliest memory? 
 
I look at him quizzically. My earliest memory  That would have been when I was 2 years younger than you are right now. You were sitting on the couch in front of me. The doctor comes into the room and sits down on the soft leather couch beside me.  Alright Frank, let  s start with a little bit of history     What do you mean?  My eyes shot open as my father starts walking back out of the room. His face is covered in blood everywhere his hair is all messed up from crying. He can  t see anything but he seems to be yelling Yelling YELLING!  Johnathan! How did you manage to grab Jonathan what happened to him? Is there something wrong does he want to live forever   The doctor walks over to me and puts his hand on my shoulder. It hurts so bad it feels like I . 
 
He looks at me for a moment, then continues.  Whatever makes you feel better about your life Dr. Poyser. You are not going to die today. There is no need to worry about that. We will take care of you when you wake up. 	I shake my head slowly, trying to regain my composure. What am I supposed to do now? . But there was blood everywhere it was all over the floor. My father starts walking back and forth in front of me, yelling Yelling YELLING! He grabbed his little brother  What did you do dad? Did you grab Johnathan what happened to him? '' His eyes shot open as he looked at me with tears streaming down his face.  No son, don  t look at me like that! Don  T look at her like that.. She has been dead for 2 years younger than you have ever seen her before she passed away from cancer. Now please just let me get out of this room so I can resume regular consciousness. Please help me sit on the couch Frank  Dr. Kremmer says while. ",,fake

3," I don  t know what you mean by that, but it  s true.    Super Earth rose two feet from the ground, his cape heroically flapping behind him. His arms stretched parallel to the ground as if he were trying to keep himself afloat. He took another breath and exhaled again.  What do you mean?  The man at the convenience store clapped a hand on his shoulder. `` We all know this is just some sort of joke, right? Whenever folks talk about how much they love Dorito flavored mountain dew, we always say,  DORITO FLAVORED MOUNTAIN DEW!  People slowly started rising out of their seats. Even wasteland lowered its head in amazement. It wasn't like anyone had ever seen such an amazing sight before. I'm going to give you one more chance to help me get back to normal. You can stay here for now. But there's no way I 'll be able to take care of you forever. '' And with that, super earth drank down the rest of his Dew-Dorito flavored Mountain Dew. *The. s cape heroically flapping behind him.  Nevertheless  Super Earth sighed and took another breath before continuing,  whenever folks talk about Dorito flavored mountain dew, they mean it in a literal sense.    People slowly started rising from their seats as Super Earth rose two feet into the air above them. Even Wasteland lowered its arms and looked at Super Earth like he was some sort of freak show or something. The man next to Super Earth asked if he had any Dorito Flavored Mountain Dew. Super Earth shook his head and said nothing. He stood up and walked over to the counter where people were pouring out Dorito Flavored Mountain Dew all over the place. As Super Earth approached the counter, an employee ran up to him and handed him a cup of Dorito Filled Mountain Dew! . I didn't know how long I've been here. But now that I think about it, I can't help but wonder what would happen if I tried to get rid of my body floating horizontal on the ground? It 'd be just like when I first got here...   That's why I don't want to go back there.. s lower jaw went flying across the room.  Come on!  cried Super Earth as he ran into the store and grabbed a bottle of Dorito flavored Mountain Dew from the shelf. He took another breath before opening the bottle and gulping it down in one gulp. The cashier at the convenience store clapped him on the back for being such a good boy, so super Earth drank the rest of the Dorito Flavored Mountain Dew with his cape heroically flapping behind him. His arms stretched parallel to the floor until they touched the ceiling above him. Then he stood up and looked out over the New York City skyline. There was no sign of any civilization left. No signs of even wasteland lowered by the winds. And then... earth stopped. . ",,fake
4,"The power was out. I groaned and slammed my phone into the couch I had been lounging on. It was summer and everyone blasting their ACs probably caused a power outage. I got up from the purple velvet couch and walked out of the living room. Dad! Can you call the power company! I yelled into what seemed like an empty house. My words echoed off the walls. The eerie silence sent a tingle through my back. Im doing it right now! Go check the electrical box first. My dad replied. Also yelling. My dad had always said a man had to learn to take proper care of the house. You know. Manly stuff. I never had an interest in building things or sports. My dad always thought of it as a weakness. I like video games and art. I dont want to nail things together in the garage. Nonetheless, I was taught. I grabbed a flashlight from the drawer in the kitchen. It was still light out but the basement and electrical room were pitch black. I walked down the wooden stairs into the basement. It was a nice basement. It was furnished and well decorated. But something felt off. I could explain it. I told myself I was being crazy. I probably was. I went about my business and went into the electrical room. I turned on my flashlight with a little click. I shined my light on the gray wooden box in the corner. I gasped. The buttons had been scrapped out. I ran my fingers along the cut metal. What is this? . I screamed and turned around to shine my light at it with one quick swoop. My dad stood there laughing. I frowned. I'm surrounded by idiots. I thought. Can you not?! Its not funny. I said in an agitated tone. Lighten up. He said patting my back. Well more like slamming all the air out of my lungs. He examined the board and frowned. Isnt it weird the buttons are missing like someone clawed it out?! I practically screamed. What do you mean? Quit joking around it is just a short circuit. He said in his usual disappointed tone. That's when I looked over and it was as if the buttons were never gone. . I scratched my head in confusion. Am I losing my mind? I thought I taught you better than that. Oh well. I dont have the parts to fix it today. I will have to go tomorrow, your sister has the car.
	I sighed. I was not looking forward to staying at home with this group of nut jobs. And especially now that our air conditioning didnt work. Hey you know what. Lets go get your mom and have a camping night! He said in an enthusiastic tone. I nodded. That was at least better than staying inside tonight. I sprinted up the stairs toward my moms room. When I knocked on the door she didnt answer. I almost thought she wasnt there. . Come in! She said. When I came in she was sifting through her closet with clothes all over the floor. This was unusual for her. She was always a neat freak. What are you doing? I asked
	She turned around and smiled at me. The smile calmed me. It sent happy waves down my spine. Oh just looking for my flashlight honey. She said in her usual voice. Okay, dad says to tell you he was thinking about having a camping night in the backyard!
	Oh! That sounds great! Ill make us lunches and start packing.
	Okay mom. . We actually had a nice set up. We had our firepit tents and picnic table. It was starting to get dark out so we sprayed ourselves with bug spray and started to cover up. Mom and dad went in their tent to grab some food. So I sat on my chair and looked out at the house. I couldnt explain it but this whole day after the power went out I felt watched. It was a chilling feeling. I hated it. I looked over at the house. I was probably just fooling myself. Dad always said I have an overactive imagination. Wait. No. A figure stood in the window. It caught my eye. The second I saw it my blood ran cold. I rubbed my eyes as hard as I could but it didnt go away. . It was pitch black now which didnt help to relieve my stress. The figure turned from a shadow to a long droopy balck mass. It had a large gaping mouth with several rows of gapping teeth. A long tongue licked the clear and pristine glass. I turned around to alert my parents. They were feet away from me. Just standing there. Guys?!!!! I said in a trembling voice. My parents looked at me. Dead in the eyes. Their eyes were almost blank. Nothing there. Just cold, darkness, and fear. The people I loved. We're gone. Thats the second I knew it. Just like the figure in the window. They morphed. . I fell out of my chair. Every muscle in my body vibrates with alarm. I reach for something. Anything. A thought radiates in my head. It is almost primal. RUN. I get myself up and run through my yard. My Converse slap against the damp lawn. My heart is beating out of my chest. I have to get out of here. I think. But where is that? Suddenly a bright light blinds me. I try to make out where it is coming from. The driveway. My sister. OH NO MY SISTER. I ran as fast as I could to the driveway on the other side of my house. I stood in the headlights with a look of sheer terror. Without thinking I climbed into the passenger seat. . ! I screamed at the top of my lungs. My sister looked at me, startled. She hesitated unsure of what to do. But she saw the look on my face and knew it was urgent. What about mom and dad? She said. Its not them! I swear they are going to kill us! I yelled. She put her key in but before she could start the car she looked forward. I have never seen here so terrified. Because there it is in the headlights. Looking right at us. There was no use now. We are already dead. . ",,real
5,"My legs feel unusually sluggish. I sit up and rub my eyes, trying to make sense of whats happening. I dont want pancakes! Cassie picks up the phone from her nightstand and starts dialing 911. She has a deeply etched face that looks like it was cut diagonally across by a sharp knife. Her voice is hoarse as she tries to speak through gritted teeth:
	What do you need?
	Sheila wants get dressed for work? Why does Sheila want pancakes? What am I supposed to do now? My hands are shaking so badly that I can barely move them at all. I look down at my faded pink bedroom slippers and notice Dave heading into the kitchen with some new avocado appliances in tow. He must have wandered away early this morning. Cassie rolls onto her side and lets out a long sigh. The smell of lavender wafts over her body, making her shiver. It feels good to be able to breathe again. A few minutes later, she turns around and sees Trenton standing on the other side of the dining room table. His hair is. I think we should get breakfast ready for you!
 
Sheila wantsget dressed? I dont even know what that means. My legs feel unusually sluggish as I stand up from the bed. What do you want? I ask Cassie. She looks at me with wide eyes. Her lips are pressed into a thin line. They look like theyve been cut diagonally across her face. Then theres something in her eyes that makes me wonder if she has cancer. And then it dawns on meshell never tell me about any of this. There must be some kind of mistake. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me. If so, why does Sheila want pancakes? What can I do to help her? . CASSIE: You have no idea how many times Im going to need your help right now. You just let me go and come back when youre ready.
	Trenton says gleefully, Itd be nice to see you again, Cassie! We were friends all those years ago. Sheila wants pancakes! Cassie picks up a plate from the table and sets it down on the countertop. I dont know what this is about, but Sheila want pancakes?
	Cassie looks at her husband with wide-eyed confusion. He nods his head in agreement. She shakes her head as if trying to convince herself that shes not imagining things. Dave gets up and walks out of the dining room into the living room. The kitchen is empty except for some new avocado appliances. They are set up like they used to bewith different time periodwithout explicitly stating where they came from. A few minutes later, we notice Dave heading over to the window next to the dinette. . Trenton: What do you mean? I have no idea who you are! You look so much older than me! Can you tell me your last name?! Trenton says gleefully.CASSIE: (Sighing) Yes, my last name was Kennedy.Thatd be great! Thatll explain all those little problems!!. Sheila wants pancakes! Cassie picks up the phone and dials her mother. Hello?
	Its Sheila want pancakes for breakfast. She wanted to know if she could come over after school today. Her sister said she had a lot of errands to run. We dont need to worry about that right now. Just go get some help with them. Theyre having lots of little problems!"" Rushing out of the room, Cassie rushes down the hallway toward the kitchen. As she reaches the dining room, she notices Dave heading in the opposite direction. . I look at my wristwatch: 3:45 am. My legs feel unusually sluggish as I walk back into the living room. I notice Dave heading off to his office on the other side of the house. He must have wandered away early this morning or something. Maybe he was trying to catch up on sleep. I try not to think about it too much. After all, who would be able to take care of two young children without their father? The only thing I can think of is how long it has been since Ive. Its hard to tell when you wake up in a different time periodwithout explicitly stating where you are and what day it is. Cassie! Are you awake?
 
She shakes her head; she doesnt want to get out of bed yet. She wantsGet dressed. Cassie looks down at her worn-out pajama bottoms and crinkled pink bedroom slippers. Her hair is matted with sweat, and she wears a floral cotton nightdress underneath. Itll do for now. As she puts on her makeup, she notices that her eyelids are beginning to. I notice Dave heading into the dining room as I am getting ready to go back to sleep. My legs feel unusually sluggish, and I wonder if they might be tired from all the running around Ive been doing this morning. But then I hear my phone ring again. The doorbell rings twice before I answer it. When I open it, there is a tall uniformed police officer standing next to me. He has a deeply etched face and dark brown hair cut diagonally across his forehead. His eyes are wide and bloodshot.. ",,fake
6,"Gehenna left the crypt, her prize in hand. As thieves went, she was second to none. She covered her head and began walking. The bazaar was long closed by now and the courtyard, normally filled with merchants and goods and noise, was simply a wide open expanse covered in sand. Reaching the inn, she went around, to where the camels were tied. Careful not to disturb the sleeping animals, she climbed the nearby tree and entered her room through the open window. Safely back inside, she shut the window and lit a lamp. She took out the ring she 'd found in the crypt and studied it in the light before putting it ring on her finger. She turned it clockwise, and read aloud the inscription. She saw nothing. `` Why -- ''   `` I am the genie of the ring. '' `` What is your wish, Master? '' For a moment, Gehenna was overcome with the urge to wish for a different life, one where she wasn't alone. She pushed it aside. This was more important. Besides, she was better off alone. Heart pounding, she whispered, `` Cl-Clear my debt. '' `` Very well, how much do you owe the moneychangers? '' `` You misunderstand, my debt is not monetary. '' `` What then? '' `` Years ago, when I was a young girl, I found myself starving, abandoned in the streets. I wandered, alone until a poor young couple found me. They let me come into their home and cared for me. But, after everything, I was mistrustful. I took a little bit of money and fled in the night. . I've gone back there many times since, but I've never seen them. The neighbors say they don't know the people I mean. Now that I have you, I want to pay my debt to them, finally. '' The genie left the ring on a gust of wind, before returning a few moments later. In its absence, the golden ring shone black. `` It is done. '' A shadow appeared in the lamplight. Turning behind her, Gehenna saw a young child, dressed in rags. `` What is this? '' `` The couple were killed three days back. This is their orphan. '' `` Oh. '' . ",,real
7,"The great Luna-Europan economist Eukomatis will once say, 'No wealth exists in a vacuum.'In response, Urami of Babylon said, 'Unless it is dispersed, spread thin, soaked by time, as the floodwaters of the Tigris are by the sands.'-- -   It is late afternoon. The shore of the eastern Mediterranean is warm. The air is jasmines and cinnamon. The sun oozes into the sea, scatters upon the mountains to the east. Beyond the mountains, Nineveh is being sacked. Karkemil knows this because he has seen it from many perspectives. Yesterday, he is watching alongside the Assyrians from the walls. The section of the wall that is now crumbling today. Tomorrow, he is in the Median army, directing assaults upon that very section. Reflection, analysis, study. His notes are spread across the beach, anchored by old sandstone pebbles. *The Skythian Tukshena displays a remarkable grasp of masonry for a nomad. Claimed to have met Greeks in Cimmeria. * says the note in his hands. `` No. Too skilled with bow. No criminal would go through the training. '' Another note. *The Tartan Issukema found making overtures to the Persians. Claimed to be seeking clemency and mercy. Suspicious. Persians not yet a power. Why them and not the Medes? *   `` And still, '' Karkemil spoke, `` What would a criminal achieve? The Persians ascension is decades away. . A wind blows. The pebbles hold. The notes flutter and croak. Karkemil appears before Karkemil. `` Tomorrow, I see Ashur-uballit flee. A concubine asks him to stand, for he will be the next king. ``, the new Karkemil says, and vanishes. Karkemil scratches his chin and hums. `` Is she new? There are many concubines. Can I scan her blood? '' Karkemil appears again. `` Yes. New. Two years ago, she comes in from the southern desert. No baggage. No food, no water. Her skin still smooth. Little micro-scarring. Strange I did not notice. ``, and vanishes again. . `` Indeed. Why DID I not notice? ''. An echo in the wind. The notes flutter. The pebbles hold. --   It is early morning. Just after dawn, but not yet morning. A fog made of cold and ash. A great walled city that trickles into fire and corpses in the streets. An armored detachment protects a man sobbing on the ground beside a severed head. `` The king! ``, he wails, `` The Lord of Assyria is dead! Woe to us, woe to us, woe to us! '' A woman emerges from a shattered ruin singing. A miracle in amidst a massacre. A glimmer in the shade. Untouched by the battle, immune to the ash and the blood. . Her eyes are neither dead nor dying. The concubine from the southern desert? Definitely! A traveller? Unsure. Karkemil thinks. He is hidden behind a collapsed wall. He watches her movement. Her gestures. He listens for her accent. The concubine whispers to the sobbing man. She coos. The accent is hard to place. Karkemil appears behind Karkemil, and says, `` Her blood doesn't belong to this time. Definite signs of innoculation. I see her emerging from behind a dune two years ago. I can not go closer. I sense radiation. It is her. ``, and vanishes. Proof. Karkemil can now assassinate her. He waits and watches. . Grim faced warriors sit facing the fire, but there is none in their eyes. Dark as the shadows in this city of blood. Prayers are heard. Prayers of supplication and mercy. In a crimson tent, the concubine lies with the new king of Assyria. What plans do they make? The king is walking out. He looks to the sky, to the north, and walks off. A chance! It is warm in the tent. The concubine reclines upon the ground. A bowl of mercury by her side, her fingers dipped within. A solitary torch. Flickers. Her face lacks breadth. She is not stunned, but neither is she prepared for Karkemil. `` Before I kill you, tell me what deviation you planned to make to the world. . He hopes he sounds menacing. `` None. ``, her sound is a lullaby. `` Then why? A violent time to be illegally sight-seeing history. Do you not know the Assyrians are doomed? '' `` Love? ``, she laughs. Movement outside. Speed is necessitated. A quick gesture from his wrist. A microscopic dart filled with death . ",,real
8,"IA nice day outside, with various martial arts practises flooding the air. It's a good day to be out in the fresh air, and it's one of those days where you don't want to stay inside for too long. You just want to go home and relax. As you walk down the street, you notice that there is no sign of your local police department. In fact, there are no signs of anything at all. The streets are coloured completely white, except for the occasional patch of grass on the edge of the road. A few minutes later, you come across a man who appears to be trying to fight off some sort of animal. He doesn't seem to have any idea what he's fighting against, but he certainly seems to be having a lot of fun. It was an instinctive step back even before I could think about it. One fist turns into another, forcing me to fall backwards onto the floor. My eyes adjust to the light from the window as I begin to realise my mistake. Before I know it, I'm lying on the ground, unable to move due to the pain in my head. That's when I see her. She. IA moment later, one fist turns out of the other and strikes the man directly in the face. He takes an instantive step backward even though he has no intention of fighting at all. His body is now coloured completely white with various martial arts practises flooding through his mind. The next thing he remembers is waking up in a hospital bed. . It's a nice day outside, so I decide to take a stroll down the street. It's been such a long time since I've had any sort of conversation with anyone from my local police department that I don't know who they are or why they're here. They're only there on matters requiring authority, but it's not unusual for them to have their own personal guard dogs when things get tense.

I realized almost immediately that the sun didn't belong in that position in the sky. I fumbled my way into the shower stall and ducked down, waiting to die. A deafening roar engulfed me, and I could feel heat and pressure against my body. I thought that I was dying, or that I was already dead, but when it passed over me and I could still sense my breathing any doubts regarding my vitality seemed to dissipate. I opened my eyes, but I can't really say that I saw. It was extraordinarily difficult, like I had stared into a lightbulb for a few hours and there was only a corner of my eye not obscured by the tracer. The bathroom was all that was left standing, and here I was crouched in a shower. I got up and looked around. No food, no water, nothing - all that was left to me was some aspirin, some deodorant, toothpaste, dental floss, and some shampoo. I curse aloud. I kick and yell and finally sit. Tears of despair run down my face. I think about my parents and my sister, how I have no way to get in touch with them to find out if they are dead or alive, if they have suffered the same fate as me. I let the tears come but as they do, I find myself breaking into a cacophonous bout of laughter. At least if I have to do a re-enactment of the movie Threads, I 'll still be able to look and smell pretty decent before I die. I take a final glance at the mess around me and trudge off towards the road. . ",,real

There were multiple handguns, knives and magazines and other assorted weapons neatly stashed away. `` What the hell is that for? '' I questioned loudly, and nervously.

I heard the gun fire, and the sound of the shot rang through my ears. I turned to see the woman who had hired me yesterday, lying in a pool of blood on the floor. She was holding a rifle in her arms. I looked back at the man who had apparently just saved my life. He seemed to be about 40 or so, well built, muscular and had a scar down the right side of his face that went from his forehead down to his beard. `` She liked to go after the new hires '' he explained in a deep voice. `` She hires the ones she wants to kill ''   I wasn't sure what to make of this, but my thoughts were cut off by the sounds of screaming throughout the building. `` What's happening '' I asked, barely able to look my savior in the eyes. . `` What does that?

The man opens the door to reveal a tall uniformed police officer. Mr. Stromopoulos? I am Officer Sterling. It fits the description of the woman that you called about. May I come in? . ",,real

Her thoughts drifted back to Aldred Sains dream when she had first met him. He had told her about his new job at the local grocery store where he worked while his wife drifted slowly away from him. They had been married for three years now, and were expecting their first child together. All was going well.

25,"AFTER EXPERIENCING UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS I DECLARE TO START FARMING ACTIVITIES. BY, LAURENT CHRISTOPHER BILIHANYUMA,AUTHOR_ TANZANIA, EAST AFRICA. 24/05/2021. In our life ; Life will always seem hard when we hinge our happiness on the others. It's hard to be happy when you've based your entire existence around the presence of someone else in your life. Theres no doubt about it: life is hard. Its a given. Life is so hard we dont even realize how often we walk around complaining about how hard life is anymore. Its kind of trending, in fact. If youve ever found yourself crying into your hands wondering why life is so hard, you are definitely not alone. But humanity is slowly, albeit painfully slowly, starting to realize that a lot of the bad things that happen to us do not actually happen to us, they are just things that happen. Its our negative attitude or disposition that turns neutral circumstances into something full of despair and anger, confusion and frustration. You got it: emotions, thoughts, and feelings. They are what make life so damn hard. Let's see; Unemployment is a term referring to individuals who are employable and actively seeking a job but are unable to find a job. Included in this group are those people in the workforce who are working but do not have an appropriate job. . Sometimes; The term unemployment is often misunderstood, it as it includes people who are waiting to return to a job after being discharged, yet it does not include individuals who have stopped looking for work in the past four weeks due to various reasons such as leaving work to pursue higher education, retirement, disability, and personal issues. Also people who are not actively seeking a job but do want to work are not classified as unemployed. Interestingly, people who have not looked for a job in the past four weeks but have been actively seeking one in the last 12 months are put into a category called the marginally attached to the labor force. Within this category is another category called discouraged workers, which refers to people who have given up looking for a job. The categories I have mentioned above sometimes causes confusion and debate as to whether the unemployment rate fully represents the actual number of people who are unemployed. . Industrial farming provides a large amount of food for a relatively low cost. Family farming improves the local land and reduces the family's dependency on commercially grown food and grocery stores. Then; Farming and agriculture is essential to the success of society as a whole. Without farming, everyone would be forced to hunt and gather food, and it is not possible for the world's population to survive off such an eating style. Industrial farming techniques and genetically modified crops allow farmers to produce a much greater amount of food than in the past, even when using the same amount of land, which keeps food on tables. Industrial farming also employs many people, including hourly workers, seasonal workers and scientific researchers who seek to improve farming techniques. Also;
Family farming is important on a much smaller scale.Family farming provides local foods to the community when there is excess produced, and it provides for much of the family's food intake otherwise. . Small family farms also keep the land in good shape through regular tilling and care, improving the overall health of the local ecosystem. To be successful, as a farmerI must know a great deal aboutland and the products I plan to raise. Every plant and animal is a complicated organism. He who wishes to succeed in the culture of wheat, rye, corn, tobacco, or cotton, for example, must be thoroughly familiar with the characteristics of the plant, its germination and growth, the diseases and blights to which it is susceptible, and the methods of controlling them. The dairy farmer and rancher must be acquainted with the characteristics of his cattle; their feed requirements, their breeding habits, and their common illnesses. Likewise, fruit farming requires expert knowledge of tree growth as well as grafting, pruning, spraying, and fertilizing. . How should I do to select a farm? After carefully weighing the pros and cons of farming versus other occupations and deciding in favor of the former, you are ready to consider the questions: Shall I buy or rent a farm? Where shall I farm? What kind of farming shall I undertake? A wise choice takes many factors into account. To begin with, you should not buy or rent a farm unless you have had real experience in farming. You are almost certainly doomed to disappointment and failure if you undertake so complex a business without some experience on a good farm, under the guidance of a man who is a successful farmer. If you have had no experience, you should start a farming career as a hired man. After that you may be in a position to manage your own farm. Some people experienced farmers stress the desirability of starting in as a tenant rather than purchaser. . The region selected should be familiar, if possible. It is also helpful to settle where your family is known. The region should be one that has been developed for many years, or, if new land, is close to good farming areas. The kind of agriculture that pays best in the vicinity should be a guide in determining the kind of farming selected. I take example from Wisconsin is a renowned dairy state, and a dairy farmer probably has a much better chance of success there than in an area where such farming is comparatively rare. Similarly, if you prefer poultry farming, a region known for successful commercial poultry farming should be chosen. Do not select a type of farming that is unfamiliar to the region. The chances are that the soil or climate is unfavorable and that the odds are against success. . One should inquire fully into the past record of the farm, its yields, operating expenses, profits, and so on. Advice can usually be freely obtained from such well-informed and disinterested sources as county agricultural agents. State extension services, agricultural colleges, or experimental stations, and the various farm organizations can help on broader questions. What questions should I consider when farming? Climate is a key factor in determining the kinds of crops that can be grown, crop yields, and the type of livestock that will thrive in the region. Some of the climatic factors to be considered are the amount and distribution of rainfall during the year, length of the growing season, severity of the winters, and the possibility of such natural hazards as drought, flood, hailstorms, windstorms, and the like. . The size of the farm is naturally a major consideration. Half the nations 6 million farms produce very little for salein fact, only about 10 per cent of the total commercial produce. Before the war, many of the small farms, especially in such areas as the southern Appalachians, had more manpower than was needed. The size of farm which a family can handle is constantly increasing as more machinery comes into use. For example, a farmer using one horse can plant an average of 5.5 acres of row crops, such as potatoes or corn, in a ten-hour day; with two horses he can plant 11.5 acres; but with a two-row planter and a tractor, 17 acres; and with a four-row tractor outfit, 33 acres. . There are other factors to consider in choosing a farm, such as, are good roads available to haul the produce to market? A farm on a dirt road may be snowbound in winter or inaccessible during wet weather, and the farmer will be unable to get his milk, eggs, fruit, vegetables, and other products to market before they spoil. Lastly but not least, the community advantages should be considered. A farm is a home as well as a business. A neighborhood with good schools, active churches, and social organizations such as lodges and farmers clubs is likely to be a place where farmers are fairly successful. A region with poor schools and backward community organizations is apt to have poor and struggling farmers. Hence I come to realize that we have no way out to bit unemployment problems unless we obviously start farming or Agriculture in our community. . ",,real
26," I  m Grogon.    The human huddled around the tabletop game like it was some kind of sacred ritual. Their intense, focused expressions softly illuminated by a dozen colorful playing cards that glittered in the dim light.  It  s time to play,  Blizzt said soothingly. He was a turquoise alien slavemaster who had been assigned to guard the bunker five miles down the road from where they were holed up. His name was Fred, and he was one of the best friends together. They had been best friends for thirty years before the human war thirty years ago. And now they were best friends again. For three days  worth of extra dice roll playing cards. Three days of fun. Four days of peace. Five days of rest. One day of freedom. The humans looked at each other with their eyes wide open as they shuffled through the half-eaten bowls of food on the table next to them. A few of them took off their hats and held them high above their heads while others tried to make sense of the strange situation. Most of them seemed to be trying to figure out what. s game shops got blown up by atomic weapons thirty years ago.    Grogon smiled innocently.  Well, I guess we have three days  worth of extra dice roll playing cards in our bag,  Blizzt said soothingly. He pulled out a dozen colorful playing cards from his pocket. They were all decked out in different colors : blue, red, green, yellow, pink, purple, orange, and black. Each card had an extra die rolling that could be used to assign two damage points to any player who rolled it correctly. The rest of the party was still huddled around the campfire, listening to the sounds of the war being fought across the world. . He looked down at the half-armed mutant pikeman on the floor next to him. His eyes glistened with tears as he tried to remember what happened during the nuclear war. It wasn  t long before they found their way back to the bunker five miles into the woods. A few minutes later, there was a knock at the door. There was no one inside. No sign of life. Just silence. Finally, Fred opened the door slowly. .    Grogon smiled innocently and said,  Well, I guess you could call me Blizzt.  He gestured towards his turquoise alien slavemaster.  That  s my name for short,  BlizzT said wearily. The human huddled around the tabletop game like a bunch of stuffed animals. Their intense, concentrated expressions softly illuminated by the glow of the playing cards in front of them. They weren't sure if it was from the extra dice roll playing cards or some sort of magic trick that had been pulled out of the aliens  heads. Either way, none of them knew how to play the game. As much as they wanted to. He looked down at the dozen colorful playing cards on the table before him. Each card had three days  worth of extra dice rolling ; one per player. It wasn  t long before he realized that this was going to be a lot more fun than any tabletop game like the ones he used to play when he was a kid. *Grogon felt satisfied with himself. After all, there was nothing else to do but sit here and enjoy each other . s human huddled around it in fear.    Grogon smiled innocently.  We were best friends together for thirty years, you know. Until we got blown up by atomic weapons thirty years ago.     I remember!  Blizzt said soothingly as they continued to talk about their lives after the nuclear bombs went off. Their focused expressions softly illuminated the room where they were sitting. They both knew what happened next. The world would never be the same again. . ",,fake
27,"Took me a bit to write this one - going to break it into two comments  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The members of Los Angeles Subway Shelter 4 gathered around the crackling fire in the ruins of the Vermont Street station, platform 2. It was here that the survivors could enjoy a rare luxury in the atomic wastes of Southern California : a warm night inside an old passenger train, with many of its seats intact. Seated next to the fire was the Old Man, one of the few old enough to have lived through The Attack itself. He tended to his cast iron skillet sitting atop a Coleman campfire cooking rack that straddled both sides of the campfire. As the rest of the survivors gathered around the fire, the Old Man served each of them a modest serving of meat - transferring the contents of the skillet to the bare hands of the survivors by way of an improvised set of tongs. Following that, each survivor poured themselves a cup of unfiltered, dirty water that had been collected at the broken water main in Union Station the day before. The Old Man chuckled. `` Back in my day, people used to bitch about the fluoride the city added to the water supply... To help people's teeth, '' he grumbled. `` And they used to say that these 'books'were antiquated... '' The Old Man thumped his well-worn hardback copy of *How to Make Love Like a Porn Star : A Cautionary Tale* by Jenna Jameson, requested by virtually every youngling he 'd ever taught how to read. . `` That they 'd be replaced by eBooks and eLearning... Morons. '' ``... Great grandfather, '' one of the younglings began, ``... could you tell us the story of The Attack one more time? I 'd like to hear the part about Dennis Rodman again! And Bay of Pigs 2! '' The Old Man laughed. `` Oh Dennis, you've heard this story at least a dozen times... ''   `` Pleeeeeeeeeease! '' squealed a chorus of younglings, followed by a string of chuckles from the younger adults. `` Oh fine. Why not? So you know the back story : James Franco and Seth Rogen, two popular actors in the early 2010s, make a movie - I've explained what those are before, right? '' The younglings nodded enthusiastically. . The Old Man rustled through a small stack of books seated next to his chair and pulled out a faded, wrinkled copy of *Atlas of World Geography*. `` Here's North Korea right here, '' said the Old Man as he flipped through the oversized pages of the old Rand McNally atlas. `` People in North Korea in 2014 lived much like we do now - eating rats to stay alive ; living in the dark without electricity ; and never knowing a world with books, film, television, and the Internet. But the difference was that their things were all taken away by a big mean, man named Kim Jong Un - their leader. And the rest of the world made fun of him and his father before, but this time was different. This time North Korea was determined to establish its seat at the table of world power! '' . `` So we know what happens next? They threaten and intimidate the movie studios and get the movie pulled from distribution. But George Clooney, a famous actor, and George R. R. Martin, the famous author of a wildly popular *Game of Thrones* book and television series defy Kim Jong Un and join forces to rally the people. And it works! The movie goes on! It gets shown! Hundreds of millions of people around the world flocked to the theatres on Christmas Day, 2014 to see the grand opening. Including me - I was at a theater not far from where we are right now. '' `` Humiliated, North Korea turns to its ally from the distant past... Russia. Now you see kids, Vladmir Putin, Russia's leader was humiliated by his own behavior during this same period of time. `` And when West responded with economic sanctions against Russia, he and his party responded by arrogantly mocking them .

He was skinnier and had ginger hair, yet an air of unmistakable authority and entitlement surrounded him. He left the door open behind him and approached me, his shady buddies flanking him.  Mr Rowland.  He said firmly. I gave him a faint smile.  Hey, pal.     I  m going to need you to step into the vehicle and come with us.  He gestured to the car expectantly. I rattled my cup at him. Cold coffee splashed around inside.    He sighed and nodded to his bodyguards, who made a move on me. I let the cup go and rose from the park bench with my arms raised.  Yeah, yeah, I  m going, I  m going.     We only want to ask you a few questions, Mr Rowland.  The ginger said. The bodyguards stuffed me into the limo, then followed me inside before shutting the door behind them. Their ginger boss came in through another door and sat opposite me.

You got screenshots don  t you?     See, that  s the thing.  He said ominously.  We don  t.    I gave them a look of surprise.  Oh, really? That  s tragic, sincerely. Truly tragic. Big Brother must have had a glitch. .  Ginger was getting angry. I couldn  t help but snicker.  Hey, real sorry about that.  I made an effort at appearing sincere.  It  s the coffee, I swear. I  m on a rush, you know?    Levity was one of the few things the government couldn  t take from us, and that  s what pissed them off so easily. It was our greatest and only weapon against them. Ginger gave a look to one of the guards, who didn  t hesitate in shooting his fist out and wrapping his beefy fingers tight around my neck. I gagged and latched onto his hand.  Mr Rowland, you will reveal to us what happened on December 20th or we will extract the knowledge out of you through force. . I tapped on the guard  s fist and gestured frantically for him to let go. He looked over to Ginger, who waited and watched me choke for a few seconds before giving a nod. He released me and I sucked in air feverishly.  Jeez,  I rubbed my throat gently.  Go easy on-     Tell us what happened.  Ginger ordered.  Now.    I finished massaging my neck then brushed my clothes down. My hand slipped nicely into my coat pocket.  You want to know what I was doing on December 20th?     Yes.  He said through gritted teeth.  Okay, well.  I was stalling just to compound his wait. .  So, believe it or not I was in a staring competition.    The limo was silent.  Yeah, crazy right?     There are screenshots missing for 9 hours. That is inhuman.  Ginger pointed out.

If this was any other time or place I would avoid this guy like the plague, but you can't exactly do that during the Angel Ceremony. Thinning hair, patched up clothes, stubble over his slightly chubby chin. The angel did not, in fact, smell, but my imagination conjured up associated stinks and odors.

Dad always goes on and on about how much his angel looks and acts like a Clint Eastwood if he was a European model. This guy, whoever he was, looked like a grown up Pig-pen from Charlie Brown. I could tell he was waiting for a response from me. I gathered my thoughts and tried something simple. `` So, you obviously know my name, what is yours? '' `` My name is Cruthis. No last name, '' he laughed and revealed slightly stained teeth. `` Well... it's good to meet you Cruthis, '' I managed. What a name. Cruthis either didn't notice my confusion or was too excited to bother with addressing with it. . You're my first assignment and I've always tried to keep you safe, man.

We had the room reserved for today and the next, but I knew I couldn't talk to this guy anymore. It was time to go. . I had to interrupt his blubbering. `` Hey, look Cruthis, it was nice to meet you, but I've got to go, '' I said, starting to turn. He reached out and gripped my arm. Hard. I turned back to him and he gripped by other arm just as hard. His eyes were wide open and his face searched mine in frantic confusion. `` No! Johnny! I've waited so long to meet you for real and talk about all the times we had together. I know it's kind of frowned upon, but don't you remember your imaginary friend, Crubs? That was me! We played shadows when your mom put you to bed and played pretend outside all those times and... ''   `` Let go! '' I shouted. . `` Johnny, no, '' he pleaded.

When they had been on their way home from work, she had asked him if he wanted to join them for dinner. Of course, he said yes. They walked up to the finely crafted wooden Dinner Table that stood next to the fireplace. She handed him a piece of bread and told him to take a bite.

Syne nods her head in agreement. I look up at Master Eldrym, his deep blue eyes glowing with excitement. He turns to face me and looks down at my son. His mouth opens but no words come out. Instead he instead gestures behind him. There is a group of men standing on the opposite side of the field from where we stand. They all have sprawled battle plans over their shoulders. One of them has a six horned head pierce through the dirt. I reach into my pocket and pull out a small letter Drake had given me earlier that day. It reads, My personal letter Drake.

33,"Log Entry # 34   30 years. I was a fool. In their eyes, I was a fool, for thinking that I could pull this off, for thinking that I could find it, after 30 years since the day humanity was punished by the gods for its own hubris by sending one of their vessels to crash upon the Earth, destroying everything in a wrathful wave, for believing with every fiber of my being that the city could've withstood the fury of the deities. I had perused many documents regarding the fabled city, and even though many had discouraged me from looking for it, I could never shake that burning desire, it had been my dream for too long, and it was finally time to take action, I simply had to go on an expedition, I didn't care if I were going to be on my own, I just wanted to reach it. Dubai. It wasn't a city in humanity's eyes after the catastrophe anymore, it was a myth, a legend shrouded in mystery, our generation knows little of our ancestors'history and culture, and so we wander around this planet, searching for answers, searching for our fathers'old homes, for their villages, places like Rome, San Francisco and New York City have already been found, but no one ever thought it possible to return to Dubai, no one except me, and this passion is what brought me here today, in the sands of the state formerly known as Saudi Arabia. As I'm writing this, nothing but the desert stands before me, I have travelled around this wasteland for more than a year, but my thirst for answers still hasn't been satiated, I will continue my mission for as long as I'm breathing, the city exists, it is real, and my search will never end, I swear it on humanity's legacy. .

We watch the gentle waves slowly rock our dinghy anchored side-by-side until we reach the shoreline. Our mothers run over to hug us tight.

Fake friends, fake, fakeness. They have thinly veiled disguises on their faces so as not to draw attention to themselves. Some of them lack faces altogether. Others wear masks over their entire body except for their eyes. I am one of these people. My name is Wilhelm. You may call me Wilhelm if you wish. The last time I was called by my real name was when I was seven years old. I walk through the crowd until I find him at the far end of the room with his back to me. He looks like he just stepped out of a horror movie. His hair is disheveled and unkempt, his skin is covered in grime from the night before. His face is devoid of any expression or emotion whatsoever. In fact, he doesnt even seem to be able to see me. And then there  s Wilhelm. The mannequins are wearing thinly veiled disguises as if they lack faces altogether, but that does not stop them from trying to kill each other. They become like armored guards who have been trained for this very purpose by their masters. And so when one of them tries to kick Wilhelm attacks it becomes literally galvanized into action. But instead of going down on one knee and begging for mercy, wilhelm leaps up and kicks the mannequin right in the chest. Then he jumps off the wall and onto the ground where he begins kicking again. It's almost as if he has no control over himself anymore. This time however, he cann't get away. So he turns around and runs towards the group of men. Alla mnniskor r p ltsas.

She becomes literally galvanized by my presence as we walk away from the mannequins in thinly veiled disguises. Her hair is tied behind her ears and she wears a mask over her face so it doesn't show any signs of emotion or personality red flags. They lack faces altogether - they just look like people who have been wearing masks all their lives. We are surrounded by men dressed in suits and ties and some even appear to be holding guns.

I have always thought that is where my trust issues come from. My dad only dated again once and she was nice and so was her daughter. However, everytime her daughter did something wrong, I got blamed. My dad finally had enough of his youngest (me) being treated like that and he broke up with her. My mom is now with my step dad who is really nice and I am thankful for everything he has ever done for me. My dad was fed up with relationships after that one and has never dated again. I am actually grateful my parents got divorced, they are better off as friends. . I made it to the coffee shop ten minutes early. I sat down at a table and waited for Andy to arrive. Nearly five minutes later he was there. We greeted each other and ordered coffee. We talked and just hung out until noon, when he had to leave. We talked about family, friends, my home town, previous relationships, and just our lives in general. Anyone walking by would have thought weve been friends for years. Andy reminds me of my older brother. My siblings have always been my best friends, I would not be me without them. Finding someone in this semi forgien place that reminds me of my brother, is comforting. Within the first couple weeks after I met Andy I was worried. What if he leaves like the others? Can I trust him? Trust. . Andy and I kept hanging out and soon we opened up to each other. Ironically enough my sister came to visit and Margret was consistently trying to get Aileen and Andy together, I found it rather hilarious. Aileen was telling me about this small little house she saw for sale on her way through the city. Perfect for the two of us; that's what she said. I had previously told Andy about my daughter back in my home state. She was staying with my mom, her grandma, for the time being. My ex's mom was not supportive of our relationship and was very disapproving of us having a baby. He ended our relationship and I was forced to take care of my daughter by myself. I thought moving to a different state for a fresh start was best. . I was able to buy the house my sister told me about and Rose, Margret, and Andy helped me move out of the apartment and into the house. I got the job at the local high school. I headed back to my home state for my daughter and the rest of our stuff. Andy (who did eventually start dating my sister) was excited to meet his niece, and rushed over to help as soon as I got back. My sister was planning on moving within the next few months and opening a new branch to her business. It felt like things were falling into place, things were going the way they were supposed too. Andy and Aileen offered to babysit whenever they could and Margaret offered to babysit the day Andy and Aileen couldnt. Andy and I often hang out and despite what anyone thinks, my sister is not worried about mine and Andy's friendship. . Rose, Margret, Aileen, Andy, Jefferson, and I (including my daughter) all got together one weekend. We all had a great time and I was able to get a different kind of relationship out of it. Jefferson and I started dating a month after I had met him. He found a place near mine and it has been great ever since. He absolutely loves my daughter, he is the best with her. I could not be happier. The nightmares and anxiety attacks have majorly decreased since I have been with Jefferson. I am grateful for everyone in my life. If Andy and I did not meet that day and become friends none of this would have happened. Andy is my new found best friend and brother. I am so grateful for him and everything he has done for me, my sister, and everyone else around us. . ",,real

The first problem arose last night. Laura and I were trying to figure out the best way to spend Christmas Eve with our children. It was a tradition George brought up when he was younger. Every Christmas Eve, they would gathered around the fireplace and sing Christmas carols. They would also make homemade cinnamon rolls and fresh squeezed orange juice. The kids seemed happy about it all. Unfortunately Christmas morning arrives before we can get started. Where are we going? Laura asked as she watched Bill glance at his watch. He turned toward Laura and said, I need you to drive us around town for a while.
	Laura looked at him in confusion. She didnt know what to say. We!Sara nearly spills her coffee on the floor from laughing so hard that she had to wipe it off. Her husband walks into the living room and puts his hand on her shoulder. His face is red but he seems okay. He looks like he's having a good time. We sit down next to each other on the couch and listen to some music. After a few minutes of listening, my wife asks me if I want. Ia Christmas Eve, Sara pouted. Thats not going to happen.
 
	Laura glares back at her sister. The first problem arose last night when they got ready for bed. Laura wanted to make homemade cinnamon rolls with freshly squeezed orange juice. She couldnt wait to share them with her family. They would gathered around the table and sing Christmas carols. It was an annual tradition George brought up as a child. Every Christmas morning arrives and everyone gathers in front of the fireplace to sing their favorite holiday song. This has become a tradition over the years. When Bill drove around town this past weekend, he stopped every once in a while to pick up a cookie or two. Each year. TheLaurie@gmail.comWe have no idea how long we are going to be gone. I just know that our parentsaregoingtobedead.wordpress.comSara @reddit.com:www.reddit.blogspot.com/sara@reddit.co.comIt's been three months since we've been together.it's been 3 months since it's been four months since she's been here.that's all too long. 
 
Laura glares back at him. Dont you dare tell me about the presents Christmas Eve, Sara pouted. She turned toward Laura and said, I told you not to talk about them on Christmas Eve. Its a tradition George brought up when he was younger. Every Christmas Eve they would gathered around the table and sing Christmas carols. And every Christmas morning they would make homemade cinnamon rolls with freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast. The only thing missing from this tradition is Santa Claus. They were supposed to bring him their presents Christmas morning, but unfortunately Christmas morning arrives before they can do so. So instead of bringing him his presents, Bill drove around town until he ran out of gas. We!
	Sara nearly spills her coffee over herself as she struggles to keep her eyes open. As if in answer to that question, Bill says, Well, I guess we are going to have to go get some presents tomorrow morning. Then he gets up and walks into the living room. He turns off the TV and heads towards the dining room. When he comes back, he looks down at his feet and sigh. Ia chocolate chip cookie with fresh squeezed orange juice.
 
Laura glares back at him. You dont know how hard it is for me to do this every year. Every Christmas Eve, my family would gathered around the table and sing Christmas carols. After dinner, we would make homemade cinnamon rolls and set them out on the table. It was a tradition George brought to our family years ago. Now, unfortunately Christmas morning arrives too early for most of us. We all pile into the car and head home. The first problem arose last night when Laura decided to drive us around town. She wanted to see what kind of people live there. Her children seemed happy about being able to spend time with their grandparents. They were. TheOf course, I can not leave her alone in the house as she has no one else to talk to. So, Bill drove around town until he found a place to stay. When he arrived, he turned toward Laura and said, What are you going to do?
	Laura looked at him blankly. He shrugged his shoulders and continued driving. Finally, they pulled into a driveway that had been left open due to snow. ",,fake

The man looked somehow triumphant, despite his old age. His eyes smiled, though his face hadn't the energy. He took off his mask, breathing in the air of Mars, the new air that people had made. It had always been his wish to come here, to Mars. And he had, when he was younger, when the sands were still airless. He had made himself a promise, long before. He would die on Mars. There, looking over the waters of a new ocean, Elon Musk breathed his last, the roar of rocket engines echoing across the landscape somewhere behind, taking people yet further into the ocean of the night, just as starlight began to shine off the new sea.

I clenched myteeth and clutched to my hunting knife, even tighter to swing it back and slicethe head of the cowardly back-stabber. I shove my feet into snow and spin myarm to make a far extended swing, but when my burning eyes met the back-stabber  my arm dropped. A thrusting blade never felt so awful then it did on
that winder afternoon because my own blood, my own brother, stabbed itinto my back. Of course, he was trembling; my quick gaze on his eyes spoke it clear. My
arms all on sudden throbbed from exhaustion and my heart began pumpingmore blood. Herman...why? I said. My words were weak. His eyes didnt match mine,
maybe right then, I looked nothing but a monster to him, to my big brother. If
that were the reason, I would satisfyingly accept and apologize. My handswere coated red from blood for four tall and sturdy people, whose bodiesspread around us. My dear private dagger dripped blood; one leg had anarrow skewered through. Even my face, it probably didnt look like the kindand gentle Henry of our village. The one he grew up with playing in woods andcatching insects. Something more frightening, it would terrify him immediately. Herman drew
a knife from his belt and aimed towards me, his hands - quivering. . His eyeswere not of regret but it burned from stimulation. His jaw  clenched tightly. That look was merely an impossible task for him ever since our parentsgruesome death, I thought. Speak to me, whats the meaning of this? I asked again. Theres no meaning to this, other than the gold dagger, he answered withinheavy breathes. What dagger? I asked as nothing called to mind precisely. The one that father gave YOU, dammit, he shouted, thrusting his knife in air. He was certainly provoked but never have I seen him that way. The goldendagger housed in our hunting family for ages, our father said. He and I adoredit, placed at the highest shelf in our wooden house. . Is this all for that puny blade? I said. It costs thousands you jerk, I could buy this whole village for seven lives, theysaid they would give me all of it, he stated. His face held grinning greed andas for he mentioned they, I all but prayed that, he wouldnt say that. You mean those foreigners, did they tell you this?
 
Unlike filth like you, they took me in as a soldier and made me recognize myplace he answered. His face held a blind shine those hypnotizers stuffed intohim. It suddenly started coming clear to me  his frequent disappearance, hisunusual uneasiness towards me for a while, and lastly a sudden ambush byfour foreigners during our ordinary hunt. . I hoped that theanswer shouldnt come the worst way I was deducting it. May all my insanethoughts prove wrong. To take down a monster like you, yes he shouted. His words pierced
through the cold air and into my head. Monster...you say, I murmured under a breath. I had no idea what my face
would look then, if any case, it would be terrifying. I extended my arm
backwards and pulled out the arrow from my back followed by a gush of
blood.The shoving in snow behind me became louder and louder. The grisly
screamed escaped his mouth as I swung back letting my body loose and thrustthe arrow into the tall persons neck. His arms were at air holding a machete. . Iexhaled deeply but my mind was pitch-black and all on a sudden anotherscream filled the head. I could not respond as I immediately felt a bladepiercing through my waist and warmth stretching throughout that area. Herman didnt shed a tear doing it, or rather  he was scared. I droppedbackwards on snow, grabbed his scrawny face and brought him down withme. I clenched my fist after falling and bashed his jaw. It shook his entire skullbut I didnt let go and bashed him repeatedly and again. Blood from his mouthflowed on my hand as he dropped on his face immediately after I let go. A bed of snow surely is soft, I thought while staring up at the flakes droppingfrom heaven. I moved my hand and found the knife sticking out of my waist. . Clearly that brat didnt have enough strength to pierce through aheavy layered coat and reach beneath muscles. He is pathetic. I sat up diggingmy arms into the snow while my body aching, ready to collapse. Why? Why are you so tough to deal with? Herman cried out pulling his facetogether from blood dripping on snow. Even though those guys killed our parents, you still went to them, I said. I do not care what we used to believe anymore, I only want that gold and
they will take me in he replied trying to balance his feet again. . His eyes widen as of from a string of shiver. Maybe if my
body wasnt exhausted, maybe if I wasnt bleeding  I would definitely rip himdown for those words he could say. Our father was a privileged hunter but ever since those long-faced wickedcigar-smoking foreigners arrived with sweet words and promise of coalitiontowards the hunting hills; everything changed. They were ruthless,dominating and depraved to the core. It became clearer when they set eyesover our dagger. Their endeavours to buy it failed drastically so they begantrying of pocketing it but the villagers lured by their fancy never stood tobelieve us. Lastly, before we could realize, our house burnt to ashes with ourparents inside. Tell me where it is, he asked again. . Just tell me where it is. Did you forget how much we suffered on our own?
 
I suddenly heard his footsteps driving away from me. Perhaps, he started
questioning himself, his motives. Either way, maybe I could spare him then. Ofcourse I would, at last it was our trust that pulled us together after all thetragedies and sufferings. His dragging footsteps returned to its initial placeand immediately a rifles muzzle hit my forehead. Tell me where it is, Henry.
 
I raised my head aligning to the rifle he pointed at my head. He retrieved it
from one of the deceased baldheads. . Yes.
 
I revealed the daggers location. The rifle slipped from his hands and he
stepped backwards, turned his back at me and made his escape from the
place. I huffed, sitting miserably against a tree. The wounds wouldnt
definitely kill me but something else did. I lost my only family but I had no
tears to spare, maybe the chill on these mountains dried me up that much. Ilet my brother go, he would probably sell off that dagger to those drunkenforeigner and they would take him in as comrade cum servant. Maybe Ibecame a monster after all because the next time we meet, he wouldnt seehim any lesser than an enemy. . ",,real
