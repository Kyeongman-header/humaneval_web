I died poor and it is no wonder as to how to my family. My mother taught me that time was precious and not to wasted. I try to forget the irony of my situation as my desiccated limbs fail to free my corpse from my buried tomb. It was paid for by the state. My affairs, of course, were not in order when I met my demise. If it were not for the clumsy steps of my zombied brethren over head echoing into my coffin - I swear I could focus.

2,"`` Why, hello there! '' I wave and smile at the three shady people at the alleyway. It was barely midday, in the year 20XX. Mobs had became synonymous with the boogeyman, regarded by most as a fairy tale. However, I beg to differ. It's been 15 years since we've started working underground, and today is the big day. We're going to make the world fear our names again. We did our share of little events during those years, but all of our actions were covered up by the government to prevent panic from the populace. That was convenient, for we didn't want any heat on us until this very day. A maniacal smile reached my ears as I recall the details of this plan. `` Crazy as always, huh? '' the woman laughed eerily. Her white cloak wrapped her body, contrasting the dark long sleeves she wore. In her pale hands, the package. Beside her were two men. Both in sturdy leather clothes, their posture declaring that they're ready to pounce at any moment. I could feel their gaze piercing through my body as I move toward her. The first one, stout in stature, with shotgun at hand, was the guy that we just referred as `` Beast ''. hen he first came in, he didn't bother with petty introductions. He just asked for names, and he deleted those names from the face of the planet. His loyalty, however was proved two years after he joined, where he defended our base of operations from an enemy family. Since then, he's been welcome to dine in our table. I gaze on the second man on her right. . When we broke him out of his cell, he kept telling us to how grateful he was for taking him out. We knew he was a significant addition to our ranks, when he nearly took out the all the prison guards with his favorite gun `` Little Jimmy ''. His loyalty was then never questioned, as long as we didn't keep him from having his *fun*. I raise my hands up and they began frisking my body for any lethal weapons. It was standard procedure, nothing personal. They took out my shiv and my pistol, then went back to their posts. I laugh, and took out numerous poisoned daggers from my clothes and drop them at the ground. They both look at each other in awe, their eyes open in wonder on how those got through their inspection. `` You boys have a lot to learn still. '' I say. . `` There's a reason why he is our leader in infiltration missions. Although, it's been a while. You took your time.

'' She sneers, her beautiful face contorts into a malicious smile, reminding me of the devil inside her. The head of our family, finally having the power the government tried so hard to take. And all of the pieces finally in our hands. `` Let's start the show, shall we? Now everybody will remember us. '' I declare, as I start unlocking the briefcase. . ",,real

4,"I started waking up, and the first thing I remembered was that my head hurt. At lot. Everything was black except for the dim lights that were overhead. I wouldn't call them lights, in the same sense as fluoresant lights. It was more a glow, like the glow that you would get from a glow stick that one would use in the wilderness at night. They were very high up - 30 feet or more. And there was a slight vibration in the floor. I could tell that I was inside some sort of vehicle. It was massive. I tried to get up, but as I rose to my feet, my head swam, and immediately dropped to my knees. I was still very week. I wanted to walk around to get a feel for my surroundings. The next best thing was to just sit down and take a look around me. She seemed to be sleeping, but she was making a strange gurgling noise that didn't sound like snoring. She was vomiting. I immediately rushed over to her. She already seemed to be choking and was jerking and convulsing in its failing attempts to keep the liquid out of her lungs. I immediately turned her over on her side. I sat on the cot and held her body on its side as I tried to get her vomit from hitting the floor without falling to the bed. As I wiped her mouth I was able to notice   that she was breathing. At least that was a good sign. But she was still asleep, sedated, knocked out, or whatever that had happened to the both of us. . We were not only the only people there. In the dim of the light, I could see other bodies, either completely still or barely moving. there were thousands. Suddenly, very large holograms seemed to spring up out of the floor. Each one was an image an image of a 3D cartoon face. They had bright smiles, and they were large - at least 10 feet tall. The holograms were evenly spaced about 20 feet apart and seemed to extend down what appeared to be an endless hallway. A loud alarm started blaring. It sounded like something you would hear if you won something at a casino.
 
"" Attention contestants! Attention contestants! "" The voice was very positive and playful. ""Congratulations on your selection. My name is BiBi, your friendly game moderator. . Please wake from your sleep and direct your attention to the coordinator when he speaks."" Who was the coordinator? As all of this was happening, there was an increase of activity inside whatever moving structure we were in. What used to be a sea of almost motionless silhouettes was beginning to resemble a crowd of active human beings. People were rising to their feet and those too weak and disoriented to do so were sitting up in their cots. Almost as soon as the game moderator was done speaking, a large flat screen began to rise out of the floor next to each hologram. The screens were twice as large as the game moderator. BiBi turned ""her"" attention to the screen as if long-awaited but very exciting information was about to be announced by someone very important. The murmuring of the thousands present seemed to subside on its own. . There was a man in a black suit sitting on a large red leather chair. Judging be the shelves upon shelves of books that were behind him, he seemed to be inside of  an elegant study or library. He was wearing a cat mask that came from a different time period and was oriental in nature. After about a few seconds of silence, he began to speak. ""Greetings contestants. My name is Belisarius. I am the coordinator. I wish to welcome you to a very grand endeavor, to which all of us are now apart. You may not know it yet, but all of you participants in a historical moment."" Everyone's eyes were glued to the screen. ""War has been instrumental in moving mankind forward. It is what brought us out of caves, and into the leviathan cities that we live in under the waves. . We refer to these times as the 'barbaric ages', when man was constantly at war. He perfected this art to the point where our species was brought to the brink of extinction."" ""We know live in the ""achievement age"". We live under the waves in our mega cites, the kind that mankind has never seen, and we have world peace. But this has led to an unexpected problem. Without war, or any form of conflict whatsoever, humanity has become stagnant and progress has all but disappeared. Upon seeing this I was forced to ask myself: 'What is worse? Stagnation or destruction?' I will tell you that they are one in the same. Stagnation is just assured destruction in slow motion."" . ""
 
""That is was brings us to our present situation. Currently, all of you listening to my voice are on the General Brusilov air carrier, flying 20,000 feet above the earth's surface. For all of you, this is your first time leaving the sanctuaries below the ocean that have been the cradle of human civilization for the past 700 years. What likely none of you know, is that approximately 100 years ago, the ocean began to recede."" As he was talking, a map of the earth was shown on the screen, and it zoomed in on areas of land that I had never seen before nor new existed. ""About a decade ago, a country known in the pre-modern era as Vietnam, became habitable again. During the last phase of the barbaric ages, there was a conflict between the great nations of the world known as the Vietnam War. . 80,000 soldiers, men and women fought for a small strip of land over a period of months. Their widely differentiating beliefs on how humanity should live on this earth caused them to do everything in their power to kill those on the opposite side of this miniscule piece of land."" ""This is what all of you will do. This is why you all are here."" ""You will be repeating this battle. Everyone in this air ship is on one side. There is another ship headed to the same location. You will use the same ancient tactics and technology of those days to fight for victory. In order to survive, you must come together as a united army. You will be given the role of an ancient country of North Vietnam and her allies in the field. . ""You will take part in a battle of dominance. A clash of civilizations and ideologies."" ""And I am sure you are wondering why you should participate in this affair: This reenactment. This game if you will. Because after all, you do have a choice to participate or not."" ""First of all I would like to bring your attention to the collars around your neck."" I put my hands to my neck and I noticed there was a collar. I tried to take it off, but it would not budge. ""You cannot take these collars off. They have a timer, and once it detonates, there is a small explosive that will kill you. But if you are victorious in this battle, the collars will be deactivated. . ""This is my solution to the crisis that humanity is currently in.

5,"Twenty-Four Years
 By: Mackenzie Hebner
 
	Itd been twenty-four years since shed last seen it, but the place looked exactly the same. I suppose that is how death works after all. Six feet under always stays at six feet, neatly chiseled stone stands tall with its tell-all engravings, grass grows and is cut in routine motion, and flowers fade but the colorless stems still rest as visual aids for what once was. It was another life back then. They were young, passionate, and invincible. Traipsing through the days fueled only by the whims of young adult life, of the endless possibilities that seemed to be the essence of existence. They had been high school sweethearts. She transferred to Hannah High School her junior year. Where education is still a formality and relationships trump homework every time. Where being with the one youre head over heels for takes precedence over where you go to college. Where chasing your dreams surpasses the call of responsibility. Where quality time is penciled in over a steady job, and where the value of life is more about a moment by moment adventure than confident and guaranteed future. But that seemed to work for her. For them. Sure, it was a head in the clouds take on the world, but sometimes we get so caught up in the dangers of imagination we forget about the beauty it inspires. Perhaps it can lead to heartache, but rather live wild and free before reality strikes than to let reality sink you from the moment your toes are finally submerged by the water of life. . William and Meleah. W+M=, as it grew to be portrayed in carved away bark in the park by their houses, conveniently nestled in the same family-friendly neighborhood. Their love was one for storybooks. Layered and adventurous, never a dull moment. They were passionate and daring. Bold and committed. Fulfilled yet always seeking something new. Settled in their life though always on the move. They met junior year of high school, and all it took was one conversation, one exchange of who they were, one opportunity to be known, one deeper understanding through the simple connection of eyes, and their future was foretold. It was as if they had been handcrafted for each other and perfectly placed into each others lives at exactly the right moment. . They lived for all those around them as a symbol of hope and prosperity and courage and bliss and loving boldly. They were those people that everyone around wishes they were. The kind of people who truly walk their talk. They were phenomenal. On fire. Burning. They graduated college exactly when they planned, her with a Bachelors of Science in Nursing, ready to travel the globe saving lives coupled with the adventurous intrigue of new destinations always awaiting, him with his undergrad degree in Biomedical Science and a subsequent medical degree in order to follow by her side, taking the world by storm together, just as everyone knew they would. But, as all good things must come to an end, theres was no exception. . She never saw it coming. They were invincible. They were going to take on the world, but instead, the world took on them. He had just graduated college. He was just starting his life. It didnt seem fair. It wasnt right. And yet, it was. Not right, just reality. Reality, a new concept that came spiraling at her at hundreds of miles an hour as the thoughts of what now spun around out of control in her mind. William was all she knew. They were engaged. He was her past, her present, and was supposed to be her future. But now, everything she knew, everything she was sure about, it was fading. The whims and fancies of their boundless life seemed to finally hit a wall, catch up with reality. . And the last time she had been here, staring down at the ground which held his body the way she once did, six feet under. The next day she walked away, from all of it. Not just living in the moment, but of him, of their story, of the memories, of her dreams of changing the world, of everything shed known for the last twenty-eight years of her life. She was twenty-eight-years-old, and she had already managed to live a lifetime. January 24, 2002, she got a job across the country from where she grew up, something simple, dependable, safe, opposite from everything she had ever imagined. She had a garage sale before leaving, selling everything of his and hers. She moved to North Carolina, where her new career waited patiently for her arrival. . February 7, 2007, she met Cameron Carter. He was about two years older, something of a workaholic, but kind, caring, sensible, but even with a tint of adventure tucked away for just the right person, which just happened to be her. June 22, 2010, Meleah married Cameron Carter. They bought a house together, had two children, and lives fairly normal lives. Meleah never mentioned William, never mentioned much from before she moved to NC at all to be honest. She kept to herself, holding her past, and William in her heart, safe and untaintable yet stored in the darkest depths possible. She did grow to love Cameron. She loved her kids and she was fond of her life, but a part of her had died that day, now seeming so long ago, yet just yesterday all at once. . She was running, not facing. She was hiding, not stepping out beyond. But, it wasnt until two days before December 24, 2025, what would be the twenty-fourth anniversary of his death, that she was finally tired of running from everything she had known and loved and been passionate about. She was finally done wondering what if. She had spent the last twenty-four years dry of passion, and it had finally drained the life out of her. It was time to remind herself who she was. Perhaps it was a quarter of a century too late, but better late than never perhaps. . It may be years later, after living a second lifetime, and she may not be sure of what shell do next, but she was there now, with him, with herself, facing reality and discovering truth, and that was all that mattered. .

My husband and I just returned from our lovely weekend stay at this historic manor on the coast. We wanted somewhere special to stay over the last long weekend of the summer, and Thornwood Estate did not disappoint. Situated on a large property a few miles from a wonderfully quaint little village, the house was spacious and conveniently furnished. We enjoyed long walks through the woods and along the seaside cliffs, then returned to the house to spend quiet evenings in front of the fire together, listening to the waves crashing against the rocks. I would have given our stay 5 stars, except for a bit of a problem we had with a bat that got into our bedroom and woke us up during our last night there. Perfect for a quiet, relaxing getaway.

Posted: September 5 at 11:15 p.m. Thank you for your review, Jane. Were very pleased that you and your husband had a pleasant stay. Thornwood Estate is our historic family home, and we take great pride sharing it with visitors such as yourself. With that in mind, we were wondering if we could convince you to update your rating to 5 stars. We certainly have never had any problems with bats before. Older houses like Thornwood often shift as the temperature changes in the evening. Isnt it possible you were only hearing it settle and, being in a strange place, let your imagination get the best of you? Reviewer: Jane W.
Posted: September 6 at 9:26 a.m. . Our dog started barking at it and woke us up. It was flying all over the room trying to get out. My husband tried to catch it with a towel and got bit in the process. He still has the marks. I appreciate you wanting to maintain a high rating here on this site, but I think you should have pest control investigate so this doesnt happen to guests in the future. Reply: S. Thornwood
Posted: September 7 at 12:52 a.m. I have to say that we were very disappointed to hear you brought your dog on your stay. Pets are not allowed at Thornwood. We thought that would be obvious given the historic character of the estate. We will be inspecting for any additional damage to the house and charging you for any repairs or extra cleaning required. . Under the circumstances we think you should reconsider your rating instead of spreading damaging falsehoods in your review. Reviewer: Jane W.
Posted: September 7 at 9:17 a.m. Damaging falsehoods?! What do you mean? First of all, there were no rules posted about bringing a dog. I made sure it wasnt included in your strange list of prohibited activities like opening the shutters on the first floor or cooking strong-smelling foods in the kitchen. Bella is an exceptionally well-behaved dog and didnt cause a fuss during our whole stay except to protect us from the vermin flying around the bedroom! We will not be paying any (certainly imagined) damages. In fact, you should worry about having to pay our medical bills. Ever since we got home my husband has been having trouble sleeping. . I have reconsidered my rating: Im changing it to 3 out of 5 stars. I sincerely hope you investigate the bat issue promptly for the safety of your guests. Reply: S. Thornwood

We will be reporting this review as a malicious misrepresentation. I dont know what you think youre doing, but Thornwood Estate has an excellent reputation both on this site and in the area. We certainly are not going to let a couple of anxiety-ridden urbanites who hide in the bathroom when they hear a bump in the night tarnish it. And as for medical bills, do you think you can take advantage of us, suck us dry, to pay for your problems? You have no idea who youre dealing with. . I tried to give you a good review despite the problem we had in the bedroom. I didnt even mention the creepy groundskeeper who kept lurking around, watching us all weekend. It was terrible! And how did you know we hid in the bathroom after the bat woke us up? Did you have him spying on us!? I think youve shown your true colors. Now Im starting to understand the strange, concerned looks people in the village gave us when we told them where we were staying. Im changing my review to 2 stars -- and Im reporting you to the health authorities! Something is definitely not right with my husband. Even Bella knows it. She barks at him now when he comes up from the basement in the evening. Hes so pale. . You can expect to hear from our lawyer! Reply: S. Thornwood

But most of the time it was just him and her staring at the tv screen. It wasn  t until one night when he came home from work that she realized what had happened.

I don  t know what you mean by that.    He looks down at his feet and then back up at her. His dark coat blinks a few times as if he is trying to figure out how to explain this strange wardrobe choice, but it doesn't seem to be working. Suddenly wide awake, she tries to sit up, but her dry mouth insists that she stay in bed. Her eyes are starting to water from the lack of sleep for so long. She rubs them with her hands until they start to feel better. She stands up and walks over to the window. She peeks out through the blinds and sees nothing.

11,"Forever. They told me they were forever. They told me wed be okay. They told me no one would die. They lied. People died. Lots of people died. Everyone died. Everyone except for me. I am that one unlucky person. It has been two years since that dreadful day. Its hard to believe its been that long. I now live in the ruins of our world and am sure that I am the only person left. My days are lonely and spent focusing on trying to stay alive. I dont know why I do it. Why not just let myself die? For some reason, it feels wrong, so I choose to live. I turn to my one friend, my one true reminder of my past. His skin is blue and purple and hes a stuffed animal monkey. Mom made him for me. I named him Amar, which means forever. Because no matter what happens, he cant die; he is forever. When setting up camp for the night, I suddenly get a very intense feeling that I need to move camp somewhere else. I dont know where it comes from, but I have learned to follow strong feelings such as these. I pick up Amar and put him in the pouch on my belt. I then pack up my tent and start walking. I have a feeling that I need to go to the woods. The woods are tall and dark. The trees whisper to each other and the bushes beckon me in. It used to scare me, but not anymore. . If anything, it feels like the closest thing to home now. There are no longer animals that will hurt me. Theyre all gone now. I continue moving through the soft grass. I like how it tickles my legs. I havent laughed for a long time, but I laugh. I decide to put down my blanket and go to sleep under the stars. As I am lying down, I observe the sky. I think it would be nice to be a star  to know that everything was forever. I wonder if the stars ever look down on us, and wish that something would change. I guess that forever has its flaws, too. I wake up the next morning to the sound of birds singing. I smile. I love the birds. They make such a beautiful sound. . I called it Melody. We sang together every morning. I dont know why I remember that, but I do. I pick up my bags and continue moving. Suddenly, I think I hear a rustle and the sound of footsteps. No, thats impossible. I havent seen another living creature larger than a bird for two years. Nothing that could make this kind of noise. I must be imagining it. Then, after a few moments, I hear the sound again. I whip my head around. What I see makes me scream. I stumble back with wide eyes and cover my mouth. I dont know how it is possible. I see a boy. No way, he whispers in disbelief. . He must have thought he was alone, too. Are you real? he asks with a nervous quiver in his voice. I nod slowly. I cant believe it! he exclaims, pacing back and forth. I was always determined to find someone else, then as soon as I give up, I actually find someone. This is amazing!	I understand how he feels. Except for the finding someone part. I had accepted I was alone since the beginning. I start getting excited. I realize that after today, I will not be alone anymore. After a few moments of silence, I realize he is waiting for me to speak. Yeah, I say, slowly. I havent spoken aloud for a long time. . I used to speak, at the beginning of my solitary life. I used to narrate everything I did to myself. It had given me a sense that I wasnt completely alone. Then slowly, I began speaking less and less, until I never spoke at all. Im glad though, I say to him. Im glad that we found each other.	He nods. Im Jacob, he says. Whats your name? The question surprises me. I have not thought about my name for a long time. Hazel, I say hesitantly. Hazel, he repeats. I smile. . Jacob smiles because, well because hes happy. I think I am happy, too. Happy is a funny feeling. I havent felt it for a long time, but I like feeling it again. Jacob tells me about what hes been doing for the past two years since the Attack. I think hes been trying to live more than I have. He tells me about an entire house that he built, whereas I describe my rather nomadic life. He was in search of more food when he found me. As we talk, we set up traps for catching small animals. We exchange tricks of the trade we have learned over the past two years. My small, thin, fingers are much better for making the traps than Jacobs large ones. We end up catching one squirrel and one rabbit. . When I come back with a handful of blueberries, the animals are almost ready to eat. Jacob lets me have some delicious fruit from his backpack that he calls strueselberries. We end up saving the squirrel for later and eating the rabbit for lunch. I never like eating squirrels. They are too chewy for my liking. Jacob is a nice person. Hes considerate and full of energy. I like it when he tells me stories about the past, from before everyone died. Hes older than I, so he remembers more things from history. When he talks, his voice is full of energy and excitement. He seems as though he didnt lose his happy like I did. Maybe one day, he can help me find my happy again. . I have been thinking about this ever since we met that morning. He had been only ten miles from me the whole time, so who else could be out there? I am starting to think that it is possible that there are more people like us. We might not be as alone as we thought	Yeah, he says, contemplating the question. There probably are other people out there. Maybe one day we could go on a mission to find them. I look up in surprise. You mean you're staying with me? I ask him. I have been assuming that he would, but it is different hearing him say it out loud. Do you not want me to? he asks nervously. I hope that I can feel this way forever. . ",,real

13," Excuse me, you said you  re where now?  Rui blinks, matching the pace of the cursor on her screen, waiting patiently for her to fill in the information for the Rangers.  Well, I  m not exactly sure to be honest Miss.  A check of the Trainer ID had told her that it was a newer trainer, a Shiroishi Yuu, who had only graduated trainer school two weeks previously. A glance over the page tells Rui that Yuu is only thirteen, failed trainer school three times before he graduated, and had an Ekans registered as his starter.  Could you describe the place for me, Shiroishi-san?  Rui attempts and the young trainer gives a small laugh.  Yuu, I like Yuu.     Well then Yuu, can you describe where you are again and how you got there?  Rui waits, waving her hand in the air to get her superior over to her desk. Otsuka-san walks over, holding his steaming cup of tea and looks curious until Rui puts the child on speakerphone.  I was exploring around into Mount Moon and I keep finding these guys in black and they won  t leave me alone.  There  s a short silence.  I  m glad Hebi, Taddy, and Speary are doing good but there  s a lot of them.  Rui looks up at Otsuka-san in confusion.  I just kinda wan na leave. Can someone guide me out? .  Rui attempts to get clarified.  And some girls. Something about being on some sort of team. I dunno, my Pokemon are getting tougher fighting them so I wasn  t paying any attention.  Rui looks at the Trainer card for Yuu again. Here was a thirteen year old fighting, and apparently winning, against what sounded like Team Rocket.  I just lost track of where I was walking and I don  t know where I am now. Can you get me out of here?  Otsuka-san pats Rui on the shoulder, shrugging.  Just guide him out. We  ll send the police in the check the situation later.  Otsuka-san whispers and Rui nods, returning the call to her headset. . Her manager stays beside her, sipping at his tea, and listening.  All right Yuu. What was the last sign you remember seeing?     Um I dunno. I think it said something about cruel leaning.  Rui  s face twitches at the answer. The kid could take out a bunch of Rockets but couldn  t read a sign?  Is it possible that it said Cerulean? C, e, r, u, l, e, a, n?     Yeah! Cruel lean.  Rui wants to put her face in her hands as she hears Otsuka-san snort in laughter. Instead, she forces a smile onto her face and stuffs it into her voice. . Is there any way you can get back to that sign?     It was like a floor up.  Rui pulls up the most current map for Mount Moon on her computer, blocking out Yuu  s Trainer card. She locates the sign she thinks he  s talking about and tries to figure out where the child might  ve gone from there.  So you headed downward then.  She trails off as Yuu gives a joyful affirmative.  Which direction did you turn from the ladder?     I went right.  Yuu hums a little.  Like with my back to the ladder, right?     Exactly how I want you to think about it. .  Rui smiles. The kid is closer to the exit than he thinks he is.  That  s fantastic news, Yuu. If you  ve continued straight ahead, there  s a large cavern. Follow the left edge of that cavern and you  ll find another path.  Yuu hums along, indicating he  s still alive and receiving directions as he walks. Rui slowly guides him out of the dark cave, with a minor interruption at the exit of someone wishing to battle. He stays on the phone throughout the battle though, unwilling to hang up.  Ah! I see daylight!  He gives a loud shout and Rui listens to Yuu running along the path.  Fresh air! .  You  re safely outside then, Yuu?     Oh yeah! I think I can see the city in the distance!  An amused smile appears on Rui  s face. The child trainer certainly . ",,real

Eventually, however, the Kyron attacks stopped. That didn't justify stopping attacking everyone in the galaxy. In fact, that only served to fuel the hatred between the two sides. After all, the Khyrons had spent centuries building up an army of soldiers far better trained than those of the humans, who could not defend themselves against such superior weaponry. The Molkhrosan Empire lasted millennia, and never stopped expanding. The Kyrons never stopped attacking the human fleet, but they didn't have soldiers far better trained than their own. It was not until the Kyron attacks stopped that the humans began to regain lost territory. They were able to move their entire fleet forward at a rapid pace, without having to wait for an enemy to attack them. This led to peace talks being held between the two bitter enemies. At first, both sides had rejected peace talks, claiming that each other's actions would justify stopping attacking everyone else in the galaxy. However, after several years of war, it became clear that neither side was willing to give up their advantage. Both sides refused to let go of what they had built, even if it meant surrendering some of their most precious resources. .

She looks at me for a long time before continuing.  And if anyone else thinks they are good enough, then why should we care about them? They deserve better than us.  s hazel eyes look betrayed by the tears finally coming to her eyes.  I don  t know.     Understand what you mean?  She asks with a smile on her face, but she knows nobody  s going to believe it. Not even if they did. The truth is that neither of us say anything about how we feel anymore. Neither of us ever have. We get death threats from people who think we  re not good enough though. And everyone else thinks so too. It  d be better if we just shut up and let them do their own thing. But no one has done that for years now. Everyone else thinks they  ve got it all figured out. No one wants to hear our stories anymore. . s hazel eyes look betrayed by the tears finally coming down her cheeks.  I don  t know nobody  s good enough though.     Understand what you mean?  she asks, leaning back in her chair and looking up at me with those big blue eyes of hers. She looks so much more beautiful when she is sad than when she has smiles on her face. It makes my heart ache to see her like this but I have to keep telling myself that it will all be worth it eventually. After all, everyone else thinks they  re better than us anyway. The only difference between us is that none of us say anything about how bad we really are. We just sit there and do our best not to get death threats from anyone or anything. . s hazel eyes look betrayed by the tears finally coming to her eyes.  I don  t want you to get death threats.     Understand me, but there  s no point in us saying anything about it if everyone else thinks we  re crazy for doing what we do because we think it  ll be good for us. We know nobody  d like to hurt someone so much that they have to kill themselves just to protect their family and friends from being hurt again.  It's not good enough though is it?  You feel tears welling up in your eyes as you say those last words. The one that meant every word she had ever said to you. She was always right when she said things weren't going to work out. . s hazel eyes look betrayed.  I don  t know how to tell you that.     Understand what?  she asks, tears finally coming to her eyes. She knows nobody  s ever told her this before, but it feels good to say it out loud. It means every word is true and no one else will get death threats if they let us say anything about it. The truth hurts more than anyone else thinks it does. We both know we  re not good enough though. Everyone else thinks so too. But none of us are good enough for each other. None of us deserve to be loved by someone like you. You feel tears welling up in the corner of your eyes as you try to wipe them away with your sleeve. . ",,fake
20,"The machine shifted from a full on roar to a gentle whirl. Then it stopped making any noise. Men in lab coats moved an and began unbuckling the test subject, moving him to a table. After a quick medical examination, they determined he was physically okay. His mental state would be examined when he awoke. It was the whole point of the machine. To see if you could completely remove someone's consciousness and then replace it with another. The first half had been proven effective. There were a large number of mindless subjects already in the holding cells awaiting the second part of the trial. This man was merely the one of them. Within ten minutes he was sitting up, awake, but staring blankly ahead. He had been moved to a smaller room, empty except for a few chairs. One examiner was in the room. `` Okay, '' the examiner said, `` let's start off easy. What is your name? '' `` River Songs whats yours? '' So far so good. The examiner nodded, and continued, `` I'm Dr. Goldstein. Next question. How old are you? ''  My mommy says not to talk to strangers!!    A little odd. Let  s continue.  I  m a doctor, you can talk to those. Now, can you tell me how old you are?     Who one the nobel prize in physics in 1985?     No, I  m the one asking questions. Just answer them. Can you please tell me how old you are? . But I have a title. If my name is DiaDz, who am I to you?    Hmm. Changed their name? Perhaps two minds got mixed up. That might account for confusion.  I thought you said your name was River Songs. Which is it?     I never said that. My name is Dyn.    A third name? The examiner wanted to press even more, but the others turned on the loud speakers and ordered,  Just stick to the prewritten questions Goldstein.    The subject perked up at the speakers and looked around, confused.  You must have been talking to someone else, I am Dyn.    Okay, some consistency with the name. Next question then. . How old are you?     It is irrevalent. Please answer my question, why do you think I am waiting?    Waiting? Nevermind. Stick to the questions you  ve memorized.  Okay, what was your first paying job?     How do you log chats?     We  re getting nowhere. The subject isn  t making any sense,  Dr. Goldstein spoke to the other examiners watching in. The man, in a seemingly helpful gesture, proclaimed,  Haha I suppose. I don't get much sleep. .  The man suddenly yelled. He was now tense. It looked as though he were ready to leap out of the chair. German? He, he isn  t supposed to be speaking German.  Uh,  Goldstein was getting nervous,  what is your favourite animal and why?     MY FAVORITE ANIMAL IS A HORSE, WHAT IS YOURS!?  The man was still yelling, now leaning closer to the examiner.  w-Who is the current leader of this country?  Goldstein was now standing behind his chair to distance himself.  BARACK OBAMA!    Okay, two answers that make sense. Even if he is yelling. Goldstein sat back down in the chair. .     I DID HAVE A PNG!  The man suddenly leapt from his chair.  WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT?  He yelled as he jumped at the examiner. Goldstein fell sideways from his chair just in time to dodge.  Help! Someone restrain the subject! We need to terminate this test session!  He called to the examiners behind the glass.  NO WONDER YOU ARE HUNGRY!  The man yelled as he righted himself from the ground. The man chased the examiner around the small room. No response was coming from the loudspeaker.  I  m serious! This isn  t funny,  Goldstein announced between breaths,  I can  t keep the subject away. .     I 'M HAWING A GREAT TIME, JUST ANSWER MY QUESTION!  The subject had now bitten his own lower lip off and was still after the examiner. Finally the loudspeaker blared,  We  re sorry, we can  t terminate the test until all questions have . ",,real
21,"In my entire life, I had only ever snapped my fingers three times consecutively. My life had always been one of a second-class citizen. The heroes in the hallways had repeatedly saved those around my from minor inconveniences. A boy with super-speed could stop any attractive girl from dropping her bags. A villian boy with x-ray photoshop skills had leaked multiple pictures of every girl in the school. Those of us in the middle, with skills that could not really create great good or great evil, were perpetually ignored. I had seen multiple showdowns throughout by high school career. The hero and the villian. Somehow, the hero always won. I had seen many fights in which, given their respective power points, the villian should have been thoroughly defeated. In the end, though, every hero eventually gave in. The world I was raised in, however, required a hero to be so full of chivalry, so full of honor, that any villian with half a mind could destroy them. The heroes of my world were worse than useless. Everyone knew that a hero could not kill, and could hardly injure. Even the least-skilled villain could, with minimal skill, incapacitate a hero. Over time, I had repeatedly grown tired of the status quo. In fact, the last time that one of my best friends, a well-established hero, had been rendered entirely useless by a prankster villain who did nothing but light hero ass-hairs on fire, I decided that I would not stand for it anymore. More than anything, I wanted to be a hero. In the grand scheme of things, my power was considered more than useless. . No hero could use any potentially fatal power to its full potential. Thankfully, I was not limited in that way. On April 17, 2071, I came to a school rally like every other student. Every powerful hero in the school was showing their powers in full force. Fireworks, fireballs, lightning bolts, and ice showers were exploding from different parts of the school. Every rally like this, though, followed a very predictable pattern. As super-boy showed off his powers ( a rather egotistic name for any high-schooler ), a young villain slowly crept behind the bleachers. At the peak of super-boy's performance, a villain named ice-man arose in the gymnasium. Ice-man was actually only thirteen years old, and tended to punctuate his sentences with 'bitch'instead of periods. . Lawsuits were rampant in the age of the post-human. Ice-man propelled himself upward using pillars of ice. Standing atop one of his pillars, he blasted super-boy into the gymnasium wall, sealing his hands and feet in prisons of ice. The villainous boy then began to fire bolts of ice indescrimately into the audience. Mass fear and terror erupted, causing the students of the school to flee in every direction. Unlike the others, I did not flee. I had my fill of bullying and villainous activities. My abilities had never ranked among the strongest in the world. My abilities had never ranked among the strongest in the school. In a world where violent abilities were silenced, however, I could not help but stand up. While my comrades fled around me, I stepped down from the bleachers. . Nothing much ever happened on the first snap. The first snap was weak. Ice-man, without really noticing, burped slightly. His ice-bolts stopped for a moment while he expelled air, but he resumed them momentarily. I stepped forward again. On my second snap, Ice-man audibly farted. Once again his ice-bolts stopped firing and, this time, a concerned look crossed his face. He stayed perched atop his ice pillar, however, and he shortly began firing his bolts again. I would need to snap again. As he conjured water from the air, and froze it into a projectile in front of him, I snapped my fingers a third time. This time, a stream of urine ejected from Ice-man. Thanks to my impeccable timing, his own abilities froze that stream as well as his projectile. . ",,real
22,"Aurelies bedtime routine merely had one thing in it, and that was getting fruit snacks. No one could resist fruit snacks when they were shaped like princesses or stuffed animals. But she didnt want to eat them tonight. She wanted another opinion on the plan her parents put together for her. Can I have some fruit snacks first? a small girl whispered into her ear. Her voice was high-pitched with excitement as she tried to make sense of the situation. The little girl glanced over at her favorite stuffed rabbit, who looked up at her inquisitively from his spot on the floor next to her bed. His eyes were big and bright, and he seemed to be trying very hard not to cry. He knew how much this meant to her. I dont know what to do, the small girl whispered. Do you want fruit snacks first?
 
Aurelie was confused. Why would her parents put together a bedtime routine merely because they wanted another opinion on their favorite stuffed rabbit? How could she possibly choose between getting fruit snacks and eating them? So many questions raced through her mind as she stared at the shelves of fruit snacks towering in front of her. The only explanation made sense: no one could resist fruit snacks. But why did her parents have to make such a big deal out of it? Her parents might barge into her room while she was trying to decide whether or not to eat them. She had been told that if she ate too much, her parents would be angry with her for not being allowed to play with her toys. . s deep voice whispered in her ear. Do you want fruit snacks first?
 
The small girl whispered, I dont think so. She looked up at the sky and saw that it was starting to get dark. Her parents might barge in any minute if they found out she was getting fruit snacks before bedtime. As far as she could tell, no one could resist fruit snacks. They were shaped like princesses with long tails and little hearts on their chests. The girls who had stuffed animals knew what they were supposed to do when they got home from school. Their parents put together a bedtime routine merely for them. A few minutes later, the doorbell rang again. This time, there was more urgency in the tone of the voice. . Aa little voice whispered back. I dont know what to do, mommy.
 
Its okay, sweetie. Itll be okay. You just have to think about it for a few minutes. Im going to go get some fruit snacks from the store and then we can eat dinner together. Okay?
	Okay She nodded her head as she made her way towards the door. A deep voice whispered in her ear, Are you sure you want to try these fruit snacks first? Theyre shaped like princesses and they are so delicious! Her eyes widened at the thought of getting fruit snacks out of the store. No one could resist fruit snacks. . s deep voice whispered in her ear. I dont want to go home.
 
Aurelie took one last look at the fruit snacks towering over her bedside table. She wanted another opinion, but she was too afraid that her parents might barge in and take them away from her. They were not supposed to come into her room until 6:00 p.m., after all. So many questions raced through her mind as she stared up at the ceiling of her bedroom. What would happen if they came in? Would they be able to leave without being seen? How could they get out of their house so easily? Did they even have a car? Was it possible for someone to escape with only a few pieces of furniture? . Aa deep voice whispered to her. Im sorry, but I dont have any more fruit snacks.
 
The little voice whispered back, Why not? She looked at the shelves of fruit snacks towering over her. They were shaped like princesses, and one could resist fruit snacks with a smile on their face. But why would she be getting fruit snacks when she already had so many other options? So many questions raced through her mind as she tried to figure out what was going on. The only explanation made sense in her head: it was time to go to bed. Her parents put together a bedtime routine merely because they wanted another opinion on whether or not there should be a second night of sleep for their daughter. . s explanation made sense to her. The stuffed animals knew what was coming, and they were ready for it. Okay
 
I dont know how much longer I can hold on to this! the small girl whispered as she picked up her favorite stuffed rabbit. Her parents might barge in any minute if they found out that their daughter had been playing with a stuffed animal all night long. They wanted another opinion before bedtime. So many questions raced through her mind. Why did he have to be so big? How could he not fit into his dresser? And why did he always have to look like a princess? She looked around at the rows of fruit snacks towering above her. One could resist fruit snacks when they were shaped like princesses. . I dont know what it is, but I want to go home.
 
Aurelie took one last look at the fruit snacks towering above her bedside table. Okay She said quietly as she turned off the light and walked out of the room.

What did this mean? Why were these stuffed animals so big? Did they have to be shaped like princesses or something? Was there any other reason for them to be so large? The more she thought about it, the more confused she became. How could someone put together such a huge pile of stuffed animals? And why would they all be so small? . ",,fake

It was a hot summer day, with the humid weather engulfing me and everyone else around us. I had gotten up to go to the coffee shop ten minutes early so that I wouldnt have to deal with another damn nightmare. When I got there nearly five minutes later, I saw my new found best friend at the counter. Hey, Andy! I said as I walked over to meet him. He smiled and laughed slightly Meet you too, Marie.
Andy? he asked in surprise. We talked for a couple of minutes about our lives and how we ended up here. My parents got divorced when I was young and they moved into a small little house on the outskirts of town. IHi, Im Marie.
 
Andy. You look like you could use a drink.Oh yeah, what can I do for you? He laughed slightly Meet me at the coffee shop ten minutes early and tell me about your new found best friend! We got out of the car and went to the coffee place. It was a small little house in the middle of nowhere. The windows were boarded up because of the humid weather engulfing the area. When we walked into the cafe, everyone else around us was staring at us as if we were some sort of weirdo or something. But it didnt take long for us to become friends none the less. After our first couple weeks of friendship, we decided to eventually start dating. . We, and a few other names I didnt know. We got together one weekend at a coffee shop ten minutes early to meet up with some friends of ours from high school. Hey guys, how are you doing?
 
Im fine, just having another damn nightmare. He laughed slightly Meet me at the coffee shop in half an hour. Itll be nice to see you all again. And by the way, this is my new found best friend, Andy. You can call him Andy for short because he looks so much like your favorite football player, Tom Brady. Oh yeah, and his name is also Timmy too. So what do you think about us meeting each other after we get out of our nightmares? . We, and so on. I had previously told Andy that I didnt want to be friends with him because he was a bad person. Well, we became friends none the less. We got together one weekend after our parents got divorced. He invited me to his semi forgien place for dinner. His family owned a small little house down the road from us. It was nice to have someone to talk to about things other than my own problems. While we were out at dinner, everything started happening again. The first couple weeks it was just another damn nightmare of mine. But as time went on, more and more of those nightmares began to happen. One day when I was walking home from work, I saw an old man standing in front of my house. . I, he said. Yeah Im going to meet you at the coffee shop ten minutes early if thats okay with you.
 
We got there nearly five minutes later and sat down across from each other. We talked for a while about our lives and what we wanted to do when we grew up. He told me how his parents got divorced after he was born and they moved out into a semi forgien place in the middle of nowhere. They didnt have much money but they were able to buy a small little house on the outskirts of town. It was so nice to be away from everyone else around us. After a few weeks we became friends none the less. When everything started happening again it was just another damn nightmare. . I.
 
He laughed slightly Meet me at the coffee shop ten minutes early, Ill take your order and we can talk about what you saw in that dream. You have a lot of trust issues come from your parents so dont be surprised if this is all just another damn nightmare for you. We got to the cafe and nearly five minutes later he was sitting down next to me. So how did it go? He asked with a hint of concern in his voice. It was my first time talking to him since everything started happening. The first couple weeks were rough but then things began to get better. My parents got divorced and they moved into a semi forgien place on the outskirts of town. They had a small little house where they lived together. . I.
 
He laughed slightly Meet me at the coffee shop ten minutes early. I will be there in just a minute. Please come with me. Thank you so much for your time and kindness. My name is Andy, and this is my new found best friend, Marie. We are going to become friends none the less. And we will eventually start dating. You know how trust issues come into play? Well, that's exactly what happened when everything started happening. It was like another damn nightmare. The first couple weeks were hell. But then it got better. He never physically hurt me or anyone else around us. In fact, he didn't even look at me as if I wasn't there. That changed after about a month. . ",,fake
24,"Lets get married.
 
	What?
 
	Marry me, he shrugged. Barbara could only furrow her brow at him. On an early December evening, the amihan wind caressed their faces. Kits feet were dangling at the edge of her dim lit engawa while she sat by his side, hugging her bent knees. Between them were two mugs of half-finished coffeedecafgetting cold as they stared aimlessly at her then empty front yard. Her Japanese tea houses inspired forever home had just been finished about two weeks prior. Kit, an old college friend, was just visiting town. They had dinner in her house and went out after on her porch to chat. They talked about anything: many things. How was she? Fine. Alright, but Im thinking of moving to somewhere peaceful: maybe here? Oh yes, its beautiful here especially during the summeryou must see. Yes, I must. Was he finally thinking of settling down? No one to settle with. And like in most of their conversations before, there came silence. A necessity they both agreedand appreciatedto have in everything. A comfortable quiet between loud symphonies. An interlude. Why? she asked, pulling the wrists of her sweater to cover her fingers. Why not? He lifted his shoulders into another shrug. He twisted to face her. Lifting his right leg off the edge of the platform, he placed it bent on the floor, then leaned back comfortably against a pillar. . Whats wrong with being single in our thirties? She answered, rubbing her bare feet gently. Nothing wrong. But nothing feels right anymore, either.
 
	He was right but, Why would we marry each other?
 
Why shouldnt we?
 
Were friends.
 
Exactly.
 
Not a good reason to get married.
 
Says who?
 
Uh... say the people who married for love? She thought, but answered, Im not a fan of arranged marriage.
 
Every marriage is basically arranged. . When she didnt respond to his quip, he moved the tepid coffee to the side and moved closer. Youre twenty-nine years old, he said. You already feel too old for parties and bars, so you spend your free time at home reading, cleaning, or something. Do you really believe that youll romantically bumped into your prince charming while on a grocery run on Sundays?
 
Why not, she thought. But he was right: life doesnt usually work like that. And who did she think she was to be the exception? Okay, she said. . One thing, she said. What?
 
	Be a good friend and dont you ever lie or pretend.
 
	Why would I?
 
	And one more thing, she added, dont leave me hanging.
 
	When have I ever?
 
 
There were no flowers or ring or having to drop on one knee. It wasnt the ideal proposal and far from romantic, but it was honest and authentic. What difference would dating have made? People are people. Relationships are relationships. Thered be differences, misunderstandings, and quarrels. . No pretending to be somebody else or somebody better, because theres no need to impress the other. I am me, and he is him. He knows me, and I know him. Faults and all. Barbara would always remember that night every time she would sit on their engawa having wine, tea, or coffee. Now it was almost Christmas again, twenty years later, the amihan wind swept the bamboo wind chimes Kit bought for their forever home on a random day, and carried its melody into the distance. The door creaked open. Kit was pushing the screen door with his back, holding two mugs of coffeedecaf. He carefully laid both drinks on the small, wood, round table they bought after the wedding, and sat on his chair. Leaning forward, he pulled a pair of socks from his pants back pocket. . Especially this time of year.
 
She only smiled sheepishly, as she always did. The kids are down?
 
It was a long drive from University.
 
Hm. After putting on the socks, she pulled the wrist of her sleeves down to her hand before picking her mug up and sipped. Theyve grown up so fast.
 
Hm, he chuckled. I still remember how terrified you were the first few times you held them.
 
They looked so fragile! . Two babies for just nine months? Its a promo.
 
Kit laughed heartily, as he always did every time she says the promo thing. After their laughter died down, an interlude. Do you remember the first time we had coffee here? she asked. Why wouldnt I? he answered. We were sitting over there, he pointed at the edge where they were sitting that night. Why did you ask to marry me? The first time she wanted to ask him this was on the day they found out that she was pregnant. She was already at school one morning when suddenly she felt nauseated and threw up in her office bathroom. Still feeling lightheaded, her secretary helped her get to the school clinic. . There was something in that moment when she saw his worried face, barging in the school clinic. Something. But she opted not think more of it. Because I wanted to.
 
	Why?
 
Why not?
 
She avoided his gaze and stared at her coffee. She knew it was silly to do this now, but she had to. For years she suppressed it. Just appreciate the little things. But it was gnawing at her. Because you didnt have a better choice, did you? I was a safe choice. The last choice. Exactly. Exactly. Theres no better than best, he continued. . It was very peaceful that night, he smiled. Just the two of us talking... drinking coffee. It has always been like that with you. And that night, I just thought, this is what I want for the rest of my life.
 
He looked at her the way he always did and said, Why wouldn't  I want to marry you? Its peaceful with you.
 
She didnt know what got into him that night that made him ask her to marry him as much as she didnt know what got into her that made her say yes. But whatever it was, it gave me a friend, family, and love. . ",,real

26,"I miss the way nothing I do is ever good enough for you. They had not seen each other for a few months. No, no, its not the way you think. It made me want to be better, day after day. Not necessarily the way you wanted me to be; and maybe thats why it didnt work out between us. But you understand: if I became the person you wanted me to be, that would not have been me. He had gone back home to his country because he had needed a break from everything. He had needed a break from her, even though he could never have told her that, or himself. He had quit his job and he had gone. But I did want to get better for you, I promise. But a better me. You made me understand that I wasnt the person I wanted to be and that was really why I was not able to make you happy. I was a cheap version of myself. You deserved all of me. They had been together on and off for about six months. Counting back, it did not seem such like a long time, but it had felt ages for them, because emotions make everything epic and ancient. Then she broke up with him because he kept making her feel miserable and never wanted to spend time with her. And he agreed, he agreed breaking up was the right thing to do. Because he liked to be a tragic character and a hero, so he wanted to make it sound like it was for her own good. As if he was the one in control of the situation and not simply an idiot. . So they were not together after that. So I thought, why didnt I put all of me? I thought and I thought. I think it was because I was never sure about you, I was never sure it would work between us. Im sorry, but its true. I told you at the beginning, remember? I wasnt looking for a relationship and lets be honest, we should not have gotten together. You had just split up with your boyfriend, and I was still hurt from my previous experience even though a long time had passed. I wasnt ready for you and I think that was always at the back of my mind: I never really gave you a chance. When they had met they had started as friends. . Her boyfriend was generally not a nice person. Alcohol was involved. But enough about him. With his experience at being friend-zoned he felt safe and impartial to be that shoulder to cry on, until he realised she was feelings things for him and he was feeling things for her. When they broke up she went straight back to her ex, the abusive one, yes. I was not honest with you by not giving you a chance. When you left me, I realised I missed you. I missed your presence. I realised I had hurt you so much because, I think, deep down you had realised I hadnt given you a chance. You deserved a chance simply as a human being. You cannot be with a human being, share things with her, unless you give her a chance as a human being. . But then you left him and you went back to him. And I was so desperate to have you back because I knew I was attached now, I was in love like a teenager or like an old man, which is the same. I was crazy about you, but you were with someone else. He had declared his love for her now that she had gone back to her ex as he had never done before when they were together. He declared and declared, wrote her letters, professed his love: he used the word love a lot. He was sick himself of saying it, but it was the truth, for once. He could think only of her. I did try to get you back. I even tried to make you feel guilty. I really loved you. I love you. You said you loved me. . Remember? I had to ask you again, because your voice was so tiny and my head was so made deaf by hope, that I had to ask you again. And you said it again. You loved me, you said. But you did not split up with him, because you wanted to do things properly, which meant your way. We slept together even though you were with him. And it was beautiful. But it wasnt done properly. It was not done at all. She could not leave her ex now. There was something going on between them, a sort of contract, she wouldnt tell him. She kept telling him they were together only because of that unwritten contract, but they werent really together. Shed rather be with him. But she couldnt. . She didnt even see her boyfriend. Promise. I had to go, do you understand? I needed to go home, away. I could not live this being with you, but not really being with you. Things should be or they shouldnt. The worst is that I did understand you. I feel like I have always understood you, except when I didnt. I have never hated you for leaving me. And I dont hate you now for being with someone else (But why him, why so obviously him?). So I had to go away, you see? He had begged her for months to get back together, to forget the contract because the contract didnt make her happy. . This went on for months, and then he left, because he had to. And he had just come back now and his feelings had come back with him. I had to go, you see? But I am back and in the months I have been away, I feel nothing has changed, you are still with him, and I still love you. Do you still love me? She could only nod, because there were tears in her eyes even though she was not crying. He could see she had taken in every word, but those words were weighing on her, making her small and fragile as a thing he was going to break. And he hated his arrogance again, because he didnt know her at all if he thought she was fragile and he had the power to break her. . I am sorry. I should not have asked you to meet. I see it now. These months away I have been blinder than ever. I should have let you go and have your happiness wherever you think you can find it. I am selfish, I want you, be with you for my own happiness, it was never yours. You see? I have just become a little better again right now: I understand now that it was always everything about me and about my happiness and I dont even know what makes your happiness, what is your happiness made of? Do I even have a place in your happiness?
Yes, she said, finally interrupting him. Why are you like this? . Deaf and blind that he was, he held her. He wondered how theyd solve the issue with the contract. Why was happiness so difficult? But he also knew that in their own way they were together again in that moment and that there was no other being together than that moment. In that moment there was nothing else but them. . ",,real
27,"`` Hey, Johnny. I'm your angel. '' This man could not be my guardian angel. If this was any other time or place I would avoid this guy like the plague, but you can't exactly do that during the Angel Ceremony. Thinning hair, patched up clothes, stubble over his slightly chubby chin. The angel did not, in fact, smell, but my imagination conjured up associated stinks and odors. The short, scarred man reached out to shake my hand. I shook it instinctively, not out of politeness. His calloused hands were so thick it felt like I was shaking bands of rebar wrapped with sandpaper. `` Johnny I'm so happy to finally meet you! '' He was beaming. `` I can't wait to answer all your questions and actually spend some time together! '' I felt jipped! Most angels I had heard people talk about were downright fucking majestic! Dad always goes on and on about how much his angel looks and acts like a Clint Eastwood if he was a European model. This guy, whoever he was, looked like a grown up Pig-pen from Charlie Brown. I could tell he was waiting for a response from me. I gathered my thoughts and tried something simple. `` So, you obviously know my name, what is yours? '' `` My name is Cruthis. No last name, '' he laughed and revealed slightly stained teeth. `` Well... it's good to meet you Cruthis, '' I managed. What a name. Cruthis either didn't notice my confusion or was too excited to bother with addressing with it. . You're my first assignment and I've always tried to keep you safe, man. It was a close call with the wreck a few years ago, and a couple of nights when you were in college, but you made sure you had fun! '' he laughed again and winked at me, but I had to consciously not cringe. `` It's not always been easy. In fact, it's been a pretty rough assignment, but for you it's worth it Johnny. You've got so much potential. What I've been through for you, I 'd do it again a hundred times. When we.... ''   I couldn't stand it anymore. We had the room reserved for today and the next, but I knew I couldn't talk to this guy anymore. It was time to go. . I had to interrupt his blubbering. `` Hey, look Cruthis, it was nice to meet you, but I've got to go, '' I said, starting to turn. He reached out and gripped my arm. Hard. I turned back to him and he gripped by other arm just as hard. His eyes were wide open and his face searched mine in frantic confusion. `` No! Johnny! I've waited so long to meet you for real and talk about all the times we had together. I know it's kind of frowned upon, but don't you remember your imaginary friend, Crubs? That was me! We played shadows when your mom put you to bed and played pretend outside all those times and... ''   `` Let go! '' I shouted. . `` Johnny, no, '' he pleaded. His pathetic face just made me disgusted, it didn't register any sympathy. I still wasn't convinced this guy was my angel. No way. As I left the room I glanced back into the room and Cruthis was gone. Good riddance, whoever you are. The Registry is going to hear about this. My nose still stung with the bum's stink. . ",,real
28,"Thursday, 9 April 2020
It has been a week since I came back from the hospital. Madam has gone from utterly condescending to an excruciating silent treatment. The fear of being obsolete is slowly materialising into an unbearable reality as days go by. I know everyone is frustrated by the rising numbers of fatalities and anxious to do anything that might expose them. This anxiety is multiplied if one is living with a recovering patient. Madam has never been one to hide her feelings, and when she does, she is not very good at it. Hence, she has been spying on me through the front window ever since I came back. I assume she is noting everything I touch so that she can disinfect. I have resolved in pretending as though I do not see her if I am to continue enjoying this shade. I sympathise with her. Staying at home is a bitter pill for these corporate giants. One minute you are on top of the world surrounded by glass, flipping through statement and sipping whiskey and asserting your dominance at every chance you get, and the next, you are stuck at home, in a farm house with a buffering screen and eighty percent muted participants who sleep through your presentations, who are you going to shout at really? I am starting to wonder if she is considering retrenching me to save costs for the rest of her businesses. Afterall there isnt much I am doing here right now; the drought has stolen the little joy I found in the garden. Maybe if it could rain harder than ever seen in this desert before, it could wash away this diseases and things can settle to this new normal no matter how strange it is. I dread the scent of the wet soil. . Some of them are slipping through my brain like a handful of sand. The nonchalant interview I did with Madam for this job is one of the few vivid ones. At first, she underestimated my knowledge because I dont hold a degree, nor did I make it past standard 12 but my father gave me all the tools I needed to be a formidable farmer. He raised me in the farm. I proved to Madam that day that I wasnt just a desperate black man looking for a pass, so I wont be sent home. It was a beginning of our conservative relationship, at least from my side. She trusted me with her plants, and I trusted her to warm my wallet. Madam doesnt know much about farming, just enough to make business out it. . John this crop is dying, why arent you taking care of it? What am I paying you for John? Speak John! Shut your mouth when I speak John! The soil, she cares for it in theory other than that I am the one breaking my back and drying my throat begging the trees to grow so that I dont lose my job. I never believed in the latter before, but Madam made it clear that if the garden doesnt produce the best crops, I will be sacked so talking to plants was better than being sent back to homelands. I eventually enjoyed it and found myself dishing out my problems to them before I made journaling a habit. . These inventors just dont know when to stop they are born with a very detestable trait, laziness- they dont want to do anything with their hands all they do is create problems for everyone else. We, the ordinary citizens who doesnt see anything wrong with having a decade old phone must suffer the climate consequences on top of being at the bottom of every hierarchy ever created. Maybe Im just projecting my own fears on Madam, perhaps that is a little too harsh. She picked me after all. Who knows how many candidates were lined up for this job, but she picked John to be her loyal gardener? I must say though that I get a little uncomfortable when she looks at me, you know that look, that one that says, Im ready when you are or you can get it anytime? . And we all know how that story goes, one minute Id be comfortable between her smooth bottle legs cushioned by her forever pointy breasts and the next Id be sweating in handcuffs in the back of the police van with zero possibility of ever seeing the sun again. I cant be that statistic, the savage black man with a devil thing who violated the poor, fragile and helpless white lady, I refuse. My father would see this as a symptom of a bone engraved cowardice, but I dont care I would choose cowardice any day than to be another mans wife in prison. Anyways, the whole point of this journal was to offload my very urgent concerns about Madam: she believes that after I contracted the virus, it changed me, and that I am delusional. . She has been forcing me to go see a doctor which is very concerning because no other employee has ever been taken to a doctor except for me, perhaps let me explain a bit about the past weeks events. A lot of strange things have been happening in these past few days, firstly she mispronounced my name. I would have understood if it was a native name, we all know white people find everything that is not English very hard, hence Christian names. But its John and she still doesnt get it right. At first, I thought she was talking on the phone but then I realized she was talking to me, she called me Johan, I suppose these are similar names but 30 years working for her and suddenly she calls me Johan. You remember the sketchy looks she gives me, right? Apparently, she thinks Im her husband. . She recites a lot of stories that are supposedly the ups and downs of our relationship. Madam is really confused, and I fear for my safety. I think she might have Alzheimers or dementia or some serious obsessive with me, and this is one of the reasons I find her insistence for me to go see the doctor very alarming. I see it as a call for help, perhaps she can feel it that she is losing her mind, but her pride wont let her admit it. Ive always wondered if people realize it when they have these extreme mental issues, I guess Im about to find out. Yesterday she told me a story that I know very well because I was in the mist of it, but she twisted the details and that is freaking me out. . I and Letitia, the cleaner, were lucky enough to have a Madam far away from those atrocities. One-night, Sis Letty, as we called her reported to Madam that she was raped by Madams husband, she was crying, ashamed but you could see the suppressed rage. Madam knew she was telling the truth because this was not the first time, he had done such a thing, but she refused to take her to the hospital. She gave her an ultimatum: She could either keep her mouth shut and continue to work or go to the hospital and never come back to their house. The later was not an option because she was going to be without a pass, have to go back to the bloodbath township pregnant with a mixed baby. So, she stayed. She never spoke again, not to me, not to Madam. . I could have done better but I chose the easy way out, cowardice. She did what she was told, when done she would go back to the quarters. Sis Letty finally gave birth to a blond, healthy boy. No one was allowed to speak to the boy until Sis Letty succumbed to her sadness. Madam and her husband Mr. Peter took the child to stay with them. Not long after then Mr. Peter had a fatal stroke and left the child with Madam. Yesterday, Madam claimed that I am the father of the boy. I tried to explain what had happened, but she refuses to listen to me. She is very certain that I impregnated her. The way she was so sure I even doubted my own sanity that maybe I am the one who has lost his mind. This is outrageous. Im a gardener with no wife, no child. . ",,real

I dont want to be here, she said as the front door closed behind her. But I have to.
The rain was falling harder than it had in weeks. Her grey cobalt hair felt like a sheet of ice around her face. It looked like red pin pricks lining her cheeks and neck. She pulled out her phone from its pocket and checked the time. 7:30am. How could this be happening? The last time we were together was six years ago. We met at a coffee shop on our way home from work. There was only one other person there that day. He was tall and lanky with dark brown hair and hazel eyes. She, she had told me. I dont want to be with you anymore.
 
It was my turn to say something but I knew it would sound like a lie. She never said anything about her parents and neither did I. We walked away from each other after the pigeon nest incident last year. Neither of us walked away three years after that. That is why I am telling you this story now. It is not an easy thing to do. You see, we were very close when we first met. But once we started dating, there was no going back. No matter how hard we tried, our feelings for each other just couldn t be reconciled. There was simply too much love between us. Too much passion. So many emotions. . 
 
She looked like she was going to cry. Her dark purple nail varnish chipped and her dyed cobalt hair felt like it was about to fall out of her head. The front door closed behind her, leaving the house in a state of disarray. She had no idea where she was or how long she had been standing there. It didnt take long for her mind to wander back to that day when she first met him. A pure unfiltered love story between two people who loved each other more than they could ever know. They were inseparable from that day forward. Neither one dares venture outside again. No matter how many times I tell them not to, they never listen. When we finally broke up, he called me his angel. . She, she thought to herself. Ill see you later. She went into the kitchen and turned on the kettle. The steaming water filled the room with a soft hum that made her want to cry. It was one of those days where no one dares venture outside for fear of being forgotten moments later. Her eyes lingered on the open bin knowing instinctively what would be in there. There were scraps of chocolate wrappers which looked like red pin pricks lining the bottom of the bin. Dark purple nail varnish chipped at the edges. A few pieces of crumpled paper had been scattered across the floor. All these things reminded her of me. Of how we used to play hide and seek as children. . She... 
 
Its a pure unfiltered love story and the fourth part requires rain. It starts when we met, I was walking down the road with my backpack in one hand and her in the other. We had been dating for three years at that point and it didnt take long for us to fall in love. The way she looked at me made me feel something like adoration. Her dark purple nail varnish chipped off as she stared into my eyes. My dyed cobalt hair felt like an autumnal breeze against her skin. Our lips were so close together they seemed to flutter like butterfly wings tapping on the pavement. She smelled of lavender and rose petals. . TheThick, wet wisps filtered upwards through the cracks and crevices of the roof. They looked like red pin pricks lining the sides of the house. The wind picked up as they walked down the street towards the front door. Ill be right back, she said with a smile. She turned to face the open bin knowing instinctively that it was full of chocolate wrappers. Her eyes lit up when she saw what lay inside. A pile of crumpled chocolates, half-eaten or forgotten moments later. Dark purple nail varnish chipped on one side from years of use. Scratches of paper covered the other side of the bin. . The.
 
There was something in her voice, something like adoration that made me want to hug her again. I didnt know if it was because she was beautiful or because we were still together after all these years. I love you more than anything else in the world. You are my everything and I will always be your everything. But this is not a pure unfiltered love story. This is a story of two people falling in love with each other at the same time. The first part requires rain. The second part requires both of them to get out of the car and into the rain. And the third part requires one of us to go back inside so no one dares venture outside. . She.
 
He looked at her with something like adoration, I cant wait to tell you all about it. Im sure youll love it. Its going to be a pure unfiltered love story. Youre going to fall in love with me right there and then! He pulled out his phone and dialed the number on the front of the house. She listened intently as he drove off into the distance. A few moments later she heard the front door closed behind him. The car was silent for a moment before she turned back to look at him. His eyes were still fixed on hers, but they seemed to flutter like butterfly wings tapping against each other. . She...
 
I dont know what to do, she said as the front door closed behind her. Its been so long since Ive seen you.
	No, itll be okay, he said with a reassuring smile. He pulled out his phone and tapped away at the screen. She looked up from her book and saw him looking at her intently. There was something like adoration in his eyes that made her feel warm inside. Her heart fluttered like butterfly wings tapping against each other. It was too much for her to take in. The last time she had seen him was three years ago when we went on our honeymoon together. . ",,fake
30,"And there they were, stepping out of a slick, black limo and dressed in the suits to match. FBI, no doubt. Between two of the suited henchmen was a taller man. He was skinnier and had ginger hair, yet an air of unmistakable authority and entitlement surrounded him. He left the door open behind him and approached me, his shady buddies flanking him.  Mr Rowland.  He said firmly. I gave him a faint smile.  Hey, pal.     I  m going to need you to step into the vehicle and come with us.  He gestured to the car expectantly. I rattled my cup at him. Cold coffee splashed around inside.    He sighed and nodded to his bodyguards, who made a move on me. I let the cup go and rose from the park bench with my arms raised.  Yeah, yeah, I  m going, I  m going.     We only want to ask you a few questions, Mr Rowland.  The ginger said. The bodyguards stuffed me into the limo, then followed me inside before shutting the door behind them. Their ginger boss came in through another door and sat opposite me.  I got ta say, haven  t been in a limo before. It  s pretty nifty.  I remarked, reclining into the comfortable leather seats.  Smells like bureaucracy in here. . Ginger leaned forward in his seat and stared intensely into me, like he was trying to break into my mind with the sheer force of his beady black eyes.  We would like to know what you were doing on December 20th, 2013.     Sheesh, that  s an awfully specific date. How am I supposed to remember that? And why do you need me here for? You got screenshots don  t you?     See, that  s the thing.  He said ominously.  We don  t.    I gave them a look of surprise.  Oh, really? That  s tragic, sincerely. Truly tragic. Big Brother must have had a glitch. .  Ginger was getting angry. I couldn  t help but snicker.  Hey, real sorry about that.  I made an effort at appearing sincere.  It  s the coffee, I swear. I  m on a rush, you know?    Levity was one of the few things the government couldn  t take from us, and that  s what pissed them off so easily. It was our greatest and only weapon against them. Ginger gave a look to one of the guards, who didn  t hesitate in shooting his fist out and wrapping his beefy fingers tight around my neck. I gagged and latched onto his hand.  Mr Rowland, you will reveal to us what happened on December 20th or we will extract the knowledge out of you through force. . I tapped on the guard  s fist and gestured frantically for him to let go. He looked over to Ginger, who waited and watched me choke for a few seconds before giving a nod. He released me and I sucked in air feverishly.  Jeez,  I rubbed my throat gently.  Go easy on-     Tell us what happened.  Ginger ordered.  Now.    I finished massaging my neck then brushed my clothes down. My hand slipped nicely into my coat pocket.  You want to know what I was doing on December 20th?     Yes.  He said through gritted teeth.  Okay, well.  I was stalling just to compound his wait. .  So, believe it or not I was in a staring competition.    The limo was silent.  Yeah, crazy right?     There are screenshots missing for 9 hours. That is inhuman.  Ginger pointed out. I shrugged, tightened my grip in the pocket.  Not a lot of humanity these days anyway.     Mr Rowland, we are aware of your political beliefs. We are aware of your inclination to the radical.  Ginger  s glare was burning with hatred.  We understand that you are unwilling to conform fully to the New World Order.     Why should I?  I felt my spirit stirring within my chest. One of my famous rants was coming on. . Why can  t I be my own person?     We are not here to prattle on about our ideologies.  Ginger barked.  We  re here to learn exactly why you did not blink for 9 hours on December 20th, 2013. What were you seeing? What were . ",,real

32,"Date: November 1793
 
On this day, big brother interrupts yet again the temporary time of peace I had for myself. Its time Jonathan. Come.
 
It was time. Time for the execution. For the screams. For the blood and flesh that drenched the streets of Paris. For this barbaric event. Futile of me to stop him, I follow along as well. Curiously, as we walk to the stage big brother always desires to prattle on matters which according to him are of paramount importance, even though I dont fully comprehend them at my age. The words liberty, rights, torture and king are frequently repeated. The rest of his chattering sits vaguely on me. The monarchy betraying the common people and having us crumble and weep on the dirty streets of the city. I wish I could understand, but I cannot. Wasnt the monarchy supposed to help and protect us? If this movement was an endeavor to reduce the suffering, then why do men and women have to succumb to this unnecessary torture? As the desire for interrogation escalated, we started hearing the confusing and aggravated shouts of the crowd gathered at the plaza. Males and females of all uniforms gathered to witness this horrific event. I look around and spot a few wailing in despair, and others with overflowing marks of happiness in their oily, grimy faces. I am confused by this buzz of mixed emotions but my brother always reassures me: They are enemies of the nation, and are paying for their crimes. He did not reassure me. The moment of waiting has ceased. . They were supporters of the monarchy and enemies of freedom. My eyes keep staring at the blade, so I know when its time to shut them. Although I did just that, I forgot to cover my ears for the silent kkk sound that the blade makes when it strikes its opponent. I also didnt want to hear the explosive cry of joy that others shared. Whats worse was that there were more following. Fortunately, my brother acceded to my commands and took me to home I suppose. Just before we fully exited the area, I spotted Sophie in the background also starring at the front. She was holding flowers. She passes by my corner to offer me some fruits or other goods she has at her store. She asks about the whereabouts of my brother, Lucas, but I always inform her that he has business to attend to. . Regardless, Sophie feels it unnecessary for me to be outside alone, even though I am in the near distance of our house. Farewell little one,  she said as she disappeared into the crowd. Most strangers I encountered returned my greetings with a scowl, but she was different. Ever since Lucas has been having his special meetings, I have had the freedom to observe more of our surroundings. It was never peaceful in these parts, but now everything had taken a shift to the worst. Even though we were able to afford more food, the fear and intimidation of Parisians were almost tangible. At times, they would chatter happily in front of their houses, and other times, they would back away and dissolve in silence as soldiers or anyone unfamiliar would cross paths with us. . From what I was told, only enemies of the nations had to face that penalty. I didnt see a reason for us commoners to be agitated. Although I admit, the endless pile of corpses that were gathered up created a most unpleasant, repulsive stench that plagued every dirt and every air of the street. I wished to know why they performed such a task but big brother warned me not to ever ask such questions. Swear it with your life. You shall not question the actions of the government. Lucas had taken part in the movement that changed France. Caring for me, he wouldnt let me know the details of what he witnessed. He described it as unutterable for me. I nodded in confirmation, but I did not understand what he meant. . Other than observing, I dedicated myself to reading a few lent books. Even though I couldnt read most of the sentences. The pages were smudged in black coloring. Still, I would pretend that I understood what the pages covered, and I would often invent my characters and stories. They would live a better life than the present we had to face. My characters would have shiny clothes. Lots of food and spectacular homes to live in. They would breathe clean air and grin in their surroundings. No blades, no blood, no fear. Their families would spend time with them. The father would teach them all that is necessary to know about life and the mother would nurture them with her undying love. Love that is undying. All this occurs on the inside of my head, with my eyes closed. . As I grew bored of my position, I turned to return to my brother. Strangely tho, I noticed a tall, slender man opening the door very slowly. He too had an ominous vibe, but he didnt look particularly suspicious. Big brother never allowed me to enter while he was in his meetings, but this time I chose to participate. By sneaking inside, and hearing them. I quietly open the cracked door and shut it with ease. Every part of this house was falling apart. The staircase was in ruins and the carpets were grey instead of colorful. As I hear conversations, I approach the living room, which was the least unkempt part of the house. I peeked behind the wall and noticed Lucas sitting on a table with 3 other men. Thankfully no one noticed me. .  This is getting out of control. The monarchy may need to rise up again.
 
To have us return to our previous positions?
 
The rumors keep spreading that more and more soldiers will keep visiting. The number of executions is uncountable.
 
 THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL! They claim to be protecting France, and they are nothing but murderers. 
 
 Listen, my friend shall inform you of any uprising. His family has good connections with the government, so we will be fine.
 
 Are you sure of our plan to succeed?
 
 What other choice do we have? . With my heart beating, I tried to make sense of whatever they were discussing, but it was futile. As I waited for his company to leave, in tears I hugged my big brother and asked him:  Are you gonna be safe?
 
He petted the back of my head and reassured me that everything will be fine. There was no need to worry. And I believed him. 
 
(Wipes tears)
 
Thats why I stared in incredulity when I saw him up there on the platform, alongside his companions. I wished I could have screamed in agony and begged for his life. But I was defeated. Ultimately defeated. Everything moved so fast, that I didnt have time to cover my eyes this time. The blade descended and the cheering was at its crescendo. .

Bright lights, big lobby. Newly hatched, Ive seen the future beyond the underside of a leaf and its indoor air-conditioning. The ker-chunk of the compressor kicks in and all the leaves in the lobby dance to the man-made breeze that issues forth from the registers. On occasion, when the mood strikes, Ill pop open the old elytra and spread my wings to catch the wind, using it to provide me with a leisurely plant-crawl, all you can eat aphids. Indoors mean no birds as well, and when you land on people they smile and laugh and tell each other it must be good luck. What a world! Id like to see more of the world, before being tied down, so I have a mind to travel. Your Cousin,

What a change! Inspiration struck me, and so instead of taking my regular plant-crawl of the lobby, I decided instead to float beyond the glass walls and into the great unknown! Did you know that theres a castle in New York City? I could hear the others calling for me to return as I left through the sliding doors, but I know my way back. Aphids are plentiful here; the suns rays seem to draw them out in droves, piling upon the trunks of these great trees. . Ive seen the spiders of the park catching great numbers of insects, more than Ive ever laid eyes on in a single spot. Maybe I can adapt their method and bring back a fat sack of aphids as an apology for breaking my engagement? Decisions, decisions. My new Ladybird love and I intend to expand our horizons beyond the park. Your Cousin and Travel Correspondent,

I wish I could write with better news, but truthfully I seem to have fallen on a hard patch of life from which I cannot find purchase. She left me, I read your response, you were right; fickle summer relationships only last until the season turns, I should have known better. . If I had just followed the path that they laid out for me, Id be married and probably expecting a brood of my own. Now I languish here, one of the many, tapping on the plastic prison that lets us see the world while simultaneously reminding us that we cant reach it. Theres talk of escape, the next time the lid lifts to collect a scoop-full of us we plan to pop our elytra en masse and make for the door. Theres a small gap at the base, we think we can make it. But theres an old one here, dont even know his name, but hes nearly four and he says were fools. Hes seen attempts over and over, and they never reach beyond the front checkout counter. . And no spots, how strange is that? I was caught not far from Belvedere Castle, sunning in the ramparts and reciting poetry to her. I cant even write her name, it pains me too much; why did she leave me? Pupa love, thats what the old man says. But what does he know? When asked where hes been, he lists only his birth leaf and this damn container, not much of a life at all. But he must be doing something right, hes the oldest bug Ive ever seen, though much the worse for wear. His left wing is all wilted; he was chosen by the scoop but tried to escape himself and thats the payment he made, or so he puts it. . Hed preach patience while being pulled apart wing by wing, but Ill not die that way either. My next letter will be written from better circumstances, I guarantee you that. Pray for your Cousin,

I write to you, flightless and alone. I made it, I was part of a small handful that did, but I dont know that Id call what Im doing living, surviving is closer. I eat and drink just enough to satisfy my bellys cravings, but it gets harder with each passing day. The man pinched me in his fingertips right as I escaped, crushing the back parts of my wings in. . When the snow falls, Ill have to find a group to hibernate with or Im done for. Ive seen a few that congregate by the sewer grate on the ground below. I can probably make my way down the tree by the end of the day, and then into the sewer by the following nightfall. Im not sure what I have to offer beyond the addition of my warmth to the collective; I hope thats enough. If I dont write to you in the Spring, then know that Ive always loved you and thought of you as a brother. Tell my parents that I appreciate everything they did for me, and tell the rest of the aggregation my story; warn them not to try to live bigger than their world will allow. . 1973 - Spring
I write to you during what will likely be my last season. Ive put this off for some time; I know I should have told you long ago that I made it, but it took me so long to get here, I wasnt sure that I hadnt died somewhere along the journey myself. I was also afraid, for a long while, that I wouldnt get a return letter. The only thing that compels me to write to you now is the last drop of courage that I had in reserve. The rest of it Ive had to make use of over the years, and through the hard crucible I emerged victorious, but not without the help of others. Not long after I arrived here, circumstances transitioned in such a way as to create a Ladybird-Eden in modern times. . What few remained gorged themselves as much as possible, but they still barely made a dent in the encroaching horde of aphids that regularly ate farmers out of house and home. I came at the tail end of their summer season and by the fall I was healthier and stronger than I was as a newborn. For some reason, the story of my plight and how I earned my spots stoked fires previously unseen within the ranks of the population, and like an answer to the proverbial gauntlet thrown, they attacked the aphid population like wolves more than insects. They then used that momentum to carry them into their marital beds, where they set after it like bunnies. Farmer Gary, whose land I now live on and whose cabin we winter in, told me we were the answer to his prayers, as he cupped me in his hand and whispered blessings. I hope this message finds you satisfied, either in life or in death. . I hope that life showed you beauty, but also in some small way I hope it didnt shield you too much from pain. I hope that you had the children you wanted; I was granted more sons and daughters than I deserved, and each with their own special brand of delight. I hope that you had a son like me, because I definitely had a son like you, and I whisper a grateful thanks into the ether nightly, commending the universe on its sense of humor. I love you, I miss you, and yet you will always be close to me as you have been these last many seasons. Your brother now and forever,

36,"`` Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to put your pants back on, '' I heard a police officer say from behind me. I shook in my shoes as a little red dot circled my forehead threateningly. `` Officer, '' I started, `` I don't think you understand. '' I could hear the officer walking around to face me, so I could see him clearly. I heard static in my left ear. `` Don't say anything or you're dead. '' The staticy, low voice echoed in my ear each time I tried to move. When I woke up this morning, I didn't expect my day to end up like this. The officer looked at me sternly and began yelling, `` Sir, if you don't cooperate I'm afraid I will have to arrest you. '' `` Officer, please. Don't do this. You're risking the lives of thousands of people, '' I pleaded. **Earlier that morning. **   I woke up with a ring in my left ear. `` David. I need you to do everything I say when I tell you. Otherwise you and everyone you *think* you know will be killed. In front of you. '' He paused. His voice was deep, but deeper than a natural voice would be. He was probably using one of those voice masker things. Static. `` It is imperitive that you do everything I say. Put on your best pair of pants, but don't wear underwear. Now, after you do that, go to Main Street Park and drop your trousers and stand there. . Also, you can not respond to me, and I know where you live, David Xander Matthews. '' **Back at the park. **   `` You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of la- '' The officer was cut off by a loud bang an explosion of blood and brains all over the front side of my body. Everyone began screaming in terror. How the officer didn't notice the laser sight upon my forehead as he was facing me elludes me completely. I decided I was dead no matter what happened. Maybe there will be some sort of distraction that will help me get away unscathed. `` Don't even think about it, David. I can tell you're getting antsy to move. One **step** and you will look far worse than that cop. . You're almost done. '' I could hear sirens in the distance, how would I explain myself? I didn't kill the officer, and my pants were down exposing my un-mentionables to the majority of the public. What was this mysterious stranger planning? Before I even noticed there were police cars accompanied with ambulences and firetrucks alike. I was rushed by police officers, but as they became closer, each of them fell to the ground with an explosion of blood and skull. This man in my ear was a good shot. He had to be ex-military or something. Suddenly, a loud voice erupted from the streets of the city ; `` People of [ CITY NAME HERE ], you have been controlled by an anarchist party made up of what you people call 'Extra-terrestrials'and we are taking over this planet. .

37,"We got a letter in the mail today. We didnt open it because we knew the words that would be planted on that piece of paper. Like getting a college acceptance letter. You either knew or you didn't. War. Such a short word with a powerful meaning. The letter read, Youve been drafted for war and a bunch of other information I didn't want to be reading. Why us? Why were we basically given this death sentence, sending us into a fear frenzy. Even just the thought of going to war when we were already financially struggling, made me sick to my stomach. At this point in our lives, we didn't need this. We were told my husband would be forced to go to war in two days. Only two days. Our lives basically just started and now there was something that had put a halt on it. A day passed like nothing had changed. But everything had. This was the last day I would spend with him and I couldnt even look at his face without bawling my eyes out. I was not ready to say goodbye. The morning before he was supposed to leave, I just sat at the kitchen table, drinking hot, steaming coffee, trying to wrap my head around exactly what was happening so suddenly. I thought, 'why cant women be drafted for war too? I am not saying I would want to be drafted, but things should be more equal. Why must I watch my husband leave without a chance of coming back. My hands quaked at even just the thought of never seeing him again. I have no choice. . Jack, I cant let you do this.My face became damp and red. I could not bear the thought of this. I had to make a decision, before it was too late. I sat and wondered, What if I went instead? And it was that night that I made the decision to go to war. Listen, I need to go to your place. I would rather go to war, than see you go. I 										wouldnt know what to do with myself, Jack.		How would this even be an option? Women cant go to war. . I would just need to disguise myself. And I wouldnt make myself noticeable. Please Jack.		I leave tomorrow. There is no way we have any time to even make this decision. Youre not going, end of discussion.		Jack, Im doing this because I love you.My face was now filled with tears, sad tears and guilt tears. I slowly got into bed and cried myself to sleep. I thought about the decisions I would make in the future and how they would affect my life. I thought about the fact that I needed to do this for myself, and not just for him. And it was then, I made my final decision to leave in the morning, without a trace. The next morning, I pulled myself out of bed. . I quickly changed into a t-shirt and cargo pants. I put my hair in a high bun with a hat covering. I had hoped this was disguised enough. I gave Jack a quick peck on the forehead, put a note on the bedspread and left, hoping I would walk through my house doors once again. I was scared, but a little excited. Women couldnt go to war and it was as if I was a representation of that; that women could fight just as well as men. I headed to the base where they began showing us where we would be staying, how we would be fighting, and a lot of other things I didn't understand. I was not meant for war and war was not meant for me. There was no such thing as training, we just went and fought. . As I was a sitting target, I thought about what my husband thought about me doing this, for him. The next day, I got a letter. Jack exclaimed that he understood why I did what I did, but feared that I would not return. My letter back to him reassured him that I was doing okay. I wanted him to feel safe knowing that I was going to be okay, but in my head, I feared for my life. I knew my decision to go to war would be detrimental, but I needed to do this. Fighting was hard. Sometimes it felt like I had no fight left in me. Like I was the weak link. Days went by and I felt weaker and weaker. The base conditions were gruesome and we barely got fed. I was starving. I was just trying to survive. . I wanted to go home. But I had to put up a positive front, because I didn't want to get caught. At this point, I hadn't gotten caught, but feared that I might, each day. A part of me wanted to get caught so that I could go home. But I couldnt, and that would get me in much more danger. You there sir, what is your name? A guard called out as I frantically tried to answer		Im..Im Jack. Jack Lenington. I said in my deepest voice possible. My hands were shaking and my knees felt like rubber. He walked away. I was still frantic, unable to move. After that conversation, I just kept going. I kept fighting, though I was struggling. The fight felt everlasting. Days passed. Then weeks. Then months. And then, it was all over. . ",,real
38,"I've always had trouble deciding whether to help someone or not. I'm always worried that I 'll be cumbersome while I help someone, so I tend to ignore the needs of others. It's something that I'm actively working on, and one of my main inspirations for improving my speed of assistance comes from this story that happened to me. I lived in Hong Kong back when I was a kid - out in the New Territories ( the 'rural'area ), and would take the bus home from school. The public transportation was and still is fantastic, so I was alone when I rode the double decker bus back home. When I got to the nearest station to my home, I began to walk towards the subway tunnel, which led to the pathway to my house. The path extended past this sort of village place, then went on towards a cul-de-sac. The cul-de-sac was where I lived, and took about an hour to get to. It was a long but nice walk. Unfortunately there were a lot of wild dogs around that area, and I had an almost pathological fear of dogs ( I think I was bitten by one when I was really young and I kept that fear ). At that moment in time though I only ever heard the dogs'barks ; at that moment I had never seen a wild dog. Today though, I spotted a dog lying on the pathway in front of me. First reaction was to be quiet and just step over it, since I didn't have enough space to go around. But when I actually got to the point of doing the act, I stopped. . So I turned around and began to walk back. But then I heard growling behind me. Somehow I had woken up the dog ( I think I stepped on it's tail by accident ), and it was mad at me. So, faced with the danger of being bitten, and with faded memories of other encounters with dogs rising up, I chose flight and began to run. Of course, my stubby legs couldn't outrun the fully grown dog, and it caught up to me quickly. Realising the situation I was in, I decided to turn around and fight the dog. So I promptly tried to punch its nose with my right hand, but instead got it caught in the dog's mouth. Fear of the dog wasn't ruling me anymore, and I bit the dog back. . It also hurt a lot and I was still an hour away from home. I was happy that my bag was safe and sound though. So I began to walk home. But about five to ten minutes after I began walking, I met a nanny ( they're pretty common in Hong Kong ). She had headgear, so she was from Indonesia. She was also pulling an empty little cart that was probably meant for groceries. When I walked up to her she made a gasping sound and began talking Cantonese to me. I was an expat's child though and didn't understand. She then dropped her little trolley, and lifted me up in both of her arms. She stuttered out the words, `` Come with me, I have bandaids. '' I just nodded and let myself be carried off down the pathway. . She brought me into her employer's house and sat me down. She gave me a phone and motioned to call and said, `` Parents. '' Then she went into another room while I called my parents. I told my mom what happened, she sounded flustered and told me that she would come pick me up in her car. The nanny then came back from the room she was in and was holding some alcohol, some paper towels, and those long white, wrapping bandages. She wiped off the blood that caked my hand, and added a liberal amount of the medicinal alcohol. She honestly added too much in my opinion. It honestly stung more than the bite... Anyways, she then wrapped those bandages around and told me to sit tight for my parents. My parents arrived, and I left. . But she could have easily ignored me, and that's what I probably would have done : I would think the person doesn't want my help because that person isn't asking. The nanny's speed of reaction, and her willingness to do all those medicinal acts will probably always be stuck in my mind. Even if what she did was minimal. She was just'someone's in trouble - > must help . ",,real

It wasn't that big, the town Samantha had moved to was small, 100,000 people or so. He waited outside by a column, with his hands in his pocket, trying to appear nonchalant. The bell rang and a minute later kids streamed out of the gate, past the teachers and security guards. He was searching the crowd of tiny human beings for Molly. His daughter, a beautiful girl of blond hair locks and green eyes. She had lost her front tooth but her smile was charming as ever.

He had begged her to stay, but she ignored his pleas and took herself and his only daughter away from him. He saw Molly walking to the far right of the incoming stream of children. `` Molly '' he cooed, `` Molly, over here ''. Molly turned her head and saw her dad. A smile spread across cheek to cheek, `` Daddy! '' she yelled and made her way through the crowd of kids and ran into him, arms spread wide into a hug.

Help, she mouthed, I forgot.Dont help her, Jack snickered, Time you start remembering Ab.Quintin rolled his eyes as he pulled his work out, Cmon Jack, wheres yours?This was the usual Thursday morning. Half of us remembering to do our work, the others pleading for help. Then proceeding to mess around for the rest of the lesson. The rest of the day wasnt as chill. Maths, the class from hell. I leaned against the wall all lesson, hand in the air, waiting for Mr. Lond to come help with algebra. But yet, he was distracted, as always. . Form time was boring. I read the notices for my class and then tried to beat the boys score on Temple Run as we waited for the bell to ring. Morning tea, the girls were talking about Brent liking Fi.Im positive, Abi was adamant, Jack and Will told me!Fi looked apprehensive but a little excited at the prospect. I dont know, She shrugged, I dont even know if I like him.I tuned out the conversation as they continued to try persuade Fi to go for it with Brent. I drank some water and snapped off a quarter of my protein bar. Belle offered me some popcorn, but I shook my head. I had it worked out, I had the rest of my bar and apple for lunch, another workout then dinner with my family. . It was working, I was getting fitter, smaller, more kilos gone. Just a couple more and Id reach my goal. The bell went and it was time for English. I was writing our film essay, but Mrs. Alice kept saying I could do better. I stared at my page blankly, not able to think of any new to add. PE was okay. Mr. Robert was one of my favorite teachers. We were planning a multi-day tramp and I was in charge of meals and doing the food shop. . I was excited to have my protein bar but decided to leave my apple for later. I could have it before my circuit, some extra energy. Four square, well I was king once and not for long. It was fun though but Psych after. My head just wasnt working. My assignment outline was staring at me, but it hurt to concentrate.I wanted the school day to end. It was freezing. I had two jerseys on, but it wasnt enough for todays weather. The hour dragged by. My bag felt heavy and I felt exhausted on the walk home. I wanted out of the dumb uniform and into my activewear instead.Blooming blue bruises dotted my stomach as I stared into the mirror. My eyes were rimmed black from restless nights. . My thumb flicked the elastic band around my wrist. A ring of red marks hidden under my layers of sleeves. I said hi to Mum and grabbed some water before locking myself in my room. 30 mins of HIIT and another 30 minutes of core. Time to walk the dogs. I grabbed my headphones and the dog lead, yelling that I was taking Roxy not Jasper on a walk. The peninsula was stunning in the evening sun. I dragged Roxy alone, listening to Avril Lavigne and blink182 as we walked. I thumbed through Facebook, seeing my friends post like for a like statuses and rolling my eyes at their comments. Something new popped up, on a vegan page I followed. Orthorexia, what was that. I scrolled further, skim reading the symptoms. None of them applied to me. I wasnt like that, I was just being healthy.Ana lurked behind me, smirking in the background. . ",,real

My dear private dagger dripped blood as I stared at it. It was my duty to protect this precious object from those who would try to take it away from me. The golden dagger housed in its sheath the secrets of our familys wealth and power. My heart began pumping so fast that I couldnt control it. A grisly screamed escaped my lips. What are you doing here? I asked with an unusual uneasiness towards him. His face held grinning greed while his jaw  clenched tightly into a grimace  answered within heavy breathes. He took off his jacket and threw it on the ground next to me. As soon as he had done so, dragging footsteps returned to the house. s face held grinning greed. I have been waiting for you, my friend.
 
Unlike filth like you, I dont care about the people around me. If you want to die, it will be on your own terms. You are not going to get a second chance at life here. Do you understand? He asked with an unusual uneasiness towards his words. My heart began pumping in my ears as I realized that he was right. There was no other way out of this situation than to kill him. A grisly screamed escaped from his mouth and sent shivers down my spine. His hands were clenched into fists so tight that they could barely reach beneath muscles. The blood dripped from his nose and onto his shirt. . s face held grinning greed. What is it?
 
Unlike filth like you, I dont want to take your life. He said with a smile that was as wide as the sky. His eyes were so bright they could reach beneath muscles of his body. The blade in his hand made him look even more beautiful than he had ever looked before. My heart began pumping and my breath quickened. A grisly screamed escaped from between his clenched teeth. This would definitely rip me limb from limb. All at once another scream came from behind us. It was coming from within our own bodies. We knew what was coming but we did not know when or where. Suddenly another scream filled the air. . s face held grinning greed. I am your private dagger, and you are my servant.
 
Unlike filth like you? I asked with an unusual uneasiness towards this man. His eyes widened in surprise before he answered within heavy breathes: Yes, sir. You are my Private Dagger. It is a gift from the King himself. We have been friends since we were children. He has always wanted me to be his own private dagger. And now it is time for him to fulfill that wish. The sound of dragging footsteps returned to my ears. My heart began pumping as I realized what was about to happen. A grisly screamed escaped my lips.

Unlike filth like you, I am not filthy. He answered within heavy breathes. My heart began pumping in my ears as the dragging footsteps returned to their normal pace. His eyes were fixed on me with an unusual uneasiness towards them. They seemed to be searching for something but could not find it. A grisly screamed escaped from his mouth and echoed around the room. Suddenly another scream filled the air. This one was more intense than the first. It sounded like someone was being torn apart by large animals. The screaming grew louder and louder until it suddenly started coming clear to me that these creatures were people. People whose bodies spread around us. . s face held grinning greed. You have no right to call me that?
 
Unlike filth like you, I am a man of honor. You see, this dagger was given to me by one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. He wanted it for his own personal use and he would satisfyingly accept it if my insane thoughts prove wrong. My eyes were filled with tears as I spoke these words. The voice behind me had suddenly started coming clear. It was none other than the king himself. His head was bowed low while his jaw  clenched tightly into a tight fist  looked at me with an unusual uneasiness towards him. But then again, who doesnt feel uneasy when they are about to be killed? . s face held grinning greed. What do you want from me?
 
Unlike filth like you, I am a man of honor. You will not be able to take advantage of me for your own selfish gain. His voice was deep and raspy as if he had been in the middle of a long battle. He turned his back on me and walked towards the door. My heart began pumping so hard that it felt like it would definitely rip through my chest. It suddenly started coming clear to me that this dagger didnt belong to me. It belonged to someone else. Someone who knew how to use it properly. But no matter how many times I thought about it, none of my insane thoughts prove wrong. This dagger belonged to one of the most powerful men in the world. . s face held grinning greed. If you dont do as I say, I will kill you!
 
My heart began pumping so fast that I could feel the warmth stretching throughout my body. My mind was racing with thoughts of what he would do to me. He would probably sell me for food or something like that. But then again, if his insane thoughts prove wrong, I would satisfyly accept it. The last thing I wanted was to die in this horrible situation. A grisly screamed escaped my mouth before dragging footsteps returned to their original position.

The thought of being used as a slave by these filthy people made me want to run away from this place and never look back. But then again, what could I do? This was where I had been training all my life. And now here I was, about to be forced to serve one of these disgusting creatures.

Unlike filth like you, I am a good man. A servant cum servant of the king. And that is why I have been chosen to be your private dagger. You will never know what it feels like to reach beneath muscles and feel the warmth stretching throughout your entire body. The thrusting blade never felt so real as this moment.  He pointed his finger at me. And if you dont agree with my plan, I will kill you in front of all those people! His face held grinning greed.

44,"TW: Violence, themes of mental health, suicide. II think Im confused. But no. They had my Annabel, and I had to get her back. The forces of the Dark Lord had driven us from our estate, necessitating our stay at the Northwoods Inn. I was in the midst of plotting our counter-attack when they struck at my very heart: my dearest Annabel. As we sat to our evening meal, Annabel began to eat as I waited and railed against the Dark Legions, as was my custom. No sooner had the first bite crossed her dear ruby lips than she cried out in pain, clutching her head. As I rose to comfort her, she fell, writhing from her chair. I tried all of the soothing spells I could recount, but none availed. There was time yet to save her, though it would require the deep magic, in which I was very much out of practice. Though it grieved me bitterly to leave the side of my beloved, I scoured our bedchamber. After a moment of searching, I found what I sought: my old black and gnarled wand, given me by my master many years ago. It felt strangely heavy in my hands. Was it loaded? As I pondered this, I heard a banging on the door to our rooms. I knew it must be the servants of the Dark One, and I was too old and unprepared to fend them off. Besides, the spell had to be performed at the stroke of midnight precisely to cure my dear Annabel, and I knew even in my best days I could not hold them that long. . I crawled through as best I could and crept around the Inn to hide in the shrubs opposite the entrance. Sure enough, there were two carriages baring the insignia of the Dark Lord waiting outside the Inn. More carriages arrived, and I waited still. Finally, I saw those cursed ones taking my Annabel to their carriage. They had spread a cloth to hide her from view, but I knew the curves of her body under that sheet as well as I knew my own name. But wait, what was my own name? It took all the strength of will I possessed to restrain myself from launching from the shrubs in a surprise attack, but I knew I would perish, and would not be able to save Anna when the time came. So, I restrained myself, and waited. Slowly, the forces of the Dark One departed, and I had no need to follow them. . And I knew it would be trap, as they must have realized I escaped their attempted assassination. Yet, I would go anyway, to Morganth, the prison of the damned. The prison was not far, and it was two hours yet until midnight, so I walked, creeping along the paths, dodging the
 
...headlights?
 
orno the torches, to avoid meeting any servants of the Dark One. Finally, I reached the prison, and by my estimation I had forty-five minutes until midnight. Depending on how heavily the prison was guarded, I figured I might need every one of those minutes to find my Annabel and prepare the spell. I stood across the road from the prison, bowed my head, and prayed to the Old Gods for strength. . I would have to act quickly. Decisively. I drew my wand and made for the door. To my great surprise, the door was unlocked. I stepped inside, and immediately saw a sentry, who appeared surprised at my sudden entrance. Before he could speak, I raised my wand to cast a stunning spell. I

cast my spell, and with an explosive boom, the sentry dropped to the floor. My hope for stealth was gone, but miraculously, the prison seemed lightly guarded: I saw no one but the stunned sentry. Having never been inside such a prison, I knew not where the cells would be. I hurried down the central corridor and checked each chamber. . I shuddered, thinking what might befall my Anna should I fail. Finally, I came to the final chamber and knew that I had found what I sought. The far wall was lined with the steel doors of the inhumanely tiny cells, in which each prisoner would be kept. As I strode towards the cell doors, I heard the voice of an enemy behind me, startling me. Mr. Lee, please, drop the gun. We can help you, but you cant 
I instantly felt the effects of this strange spell, as a paralyzing fear crept from deep within my consciousness. I spun and

I began to pray the prayers and speak the incantations necessary. It was difficult spell indeed, transferring my life force to Anna. One minute to midnight now. I hear the doors of the prison fly open and know that the Dark Legions have arrived in force. But it is too late for them. I have nearly completed the spell. All that remains are the final two elements. I hear the chime of midnight. I bend down and kiss my Anna on her cold, still lips, and place my wand against my temple and cast the spell. . On Monday evening, officers were called to the Northwoods Apartments to investigate disturbing sounds coming from the residence of former fantasy writer Bryan Lee. Lee achieved critical and commercial success with the publication of his first series of fantasy novels, the Mage Chronicles. Lees sophomore efforts were widely panned by critics and popular audiences, however, and Lee never regained the success of his first work. Lee had lived at the Northwoods Apartments with his wife, Annabel, for the last five years, following the seizure of his former home due to a federal tax dispute. Reports of the Lees diminishing health have been abundant but until now, unconfirmed. When authorities arrived on the scene, they found the body of Mrs. Lee in the kitchen. It has been confirmed that Mrs. Lee died of an undiagnosed brain aneurism. Mr. Lee was not present in the residence. . The injured witness stated that Mr. Lee appeared to be out of his mind and was muttering what was later determined to be DeThi, a language Mr. Lee invented for the mage tribes in his Mage Chronicle novels. Mr. Lee then proceeded to locate and attempt to remove the body of Mrs. Lee. When additional law enforcement arrived, Mr. Lee turned his gun upon himself.

Our ancestors were rough and tough, and without the internet to look up How to dodge a bengal tiger back then, the good Lord gave them the almighty amygdala to activate the fight, flight, or freeze response.

47,"Thick, tempestuous winds roll against a house from another age. The old, possibly Victorian-style mansion is lit with carriage lanterns and window candles. A young and tall woman walks up the gravel driveway with her blonde hair waving in the wind. She latches her hand around the metal knocker to announce her arrival. An older man dressed in white and black, presumably the butler, opens the door. Welcome to the Caswell Estate. May I see your invitation?
 
Reaching into her cream-colored purse, the widow pulls out an envelope with a golden sticker that once sealed its flap. Extracting a letter made with cardstock, she hands it to him. Saturday, the Eighth of July
Two Thousand Fourteen
at Nine in the Evening
 
The Caswell Estate
Scarborough, Maine
 
Mrs. Arbury, he glances up as she swallows the lump in her throat. Its Ms. Arbury, actually. Oh, my apologies, madam. Please, come in, he says as he feels the awkward tension. Thank you, she responds as she steps into the old mansion. Most of the cordially invited guests have already arrived and said their pleasantries. After all, it is 9:30 PM. Jane is fully aware of her tardiness, and even more aware of the reason for it. . Shaking away the images that always protrude, she makes her way from the long hall into the large, open ballroom. Several candle-lit chandeliers hang from the 40-foot ceiling, each one large enough to light a neighborhood. The marble floor reflects her white 2-inch heels as clearly as a mirror would. Crowding the dance floor are men and women dressed in formal clothes. Three-piece suits and long dresses are the image of the evening. Arthur Caswell, the young entrepreneur-turned-millionaire, approaches Jane. His short black curls bounce above his eyebrows as he closes the distance between them. You know, I was beginning to wonder if you would ever show up, he says with a sarcastic grin on his face. . Jane has always been fond of Arthur, but his sarcastic persistence has been somewhat of a nuisance recently. You know why Im late, she continues. I know, Jane. And this must be difficult for you, but you needed to come around eventually.
 
Distracted both by the party and a suppressed flashback, she breaks eye contact with him for the first time. Unable to stray from her past, Ms. Arbury remembers a time when she didnt need to correct people like the butler. She sees herself seven years younger. The music was bouncing off the windows of a large apartment overlooking the city. The noise complaints were justified, considering Dimitri Guthrie had just become the first man to successfully create machines that operate completely on Artificial Intelligence. . Staring into the back of his head and seeing his long brown hair moving from side to side, she is simultaneously at peace and overcome with excitement. As they plant their feet on the dance floor, Jane begins to enjoy herself. The pace at which they dance is of no concern to her, so long as she can see his happiness. A slow song comes on. One of their favorite soft love songs from the 1960s plays in the background as they draw closer to each other. Dimitri places his hands on Janes waist, hers traveling up to his shoulders. Im so glad youre here, he whispers. It means the world to me that you are by my side for this. She smiles and looks at their feet as they step in tandem with each other. . Against his will, he continues to fall limp in her arms, fearfully aware of what just happened. Panicked, Jane looks over his shoulder to see a man with a knife. He flees the apartment only to leave a trace of blood and unanswered questions. Looking into Dimitris eyes, she sees regret and sorrow. Choking on his blood, he manages to voice four words. Its  not  your  fault. She wants to scream, but she feels a lump in her throat. Youre right, she replies. I know you are. Pulling herself back into the present, she signals that she needs a drink. While the mostly gin and some tonic helps, she needed distance more than anything. . Its going to be a long night, she whispers to herself and takes a gulp. The next hour is typical of any formal gathering; the host gives a speech and shows his gratitude for everyone attending, the platters of hors d'oeuvres are emptied and filled again, and the soft jazz in the background makes way for formal conversation. Many of the attendees are closely related to the Caswell family. Some lifelong business partners, some summer holiday friends. Sitting alone at a well-set table, Jane realizes that the saying is true: the rich mingle with the rich. Older gentlemen, most likely friends of Arthurs father, are talking about politics and the stock market. The older women are telling anecdotes of how they met their husbandssome containing embarrassing secrets. As the evening approaches midnight, most guests have accustomed themselves to the dance floor. . Jane has not glanced up from her drink. She wants to avoid the questioning looks but also needs to avoid her curiosity. Practically melting the ice with her eyes, she does not know that Arthur has approached her again. Staring at it wont refill it, he says, smirking. Jane forces a laugh out, hoping it sounds convincing enough. I was waiting for you, she fires back. He laughs, grabs the glass, and returns with another gin and tonic. So, I hate to address the elephant in the room, but have you found anything new? Well, she replies after letting out a long sigh, its not an elephant if its just between us. Its more like a horse. . Its been seven years, you know. Maybe I should just give up. Sympathy fills his face. J, thats not what I meant. I know, she answers quickly, almost as if doing so would change his reaction. But at some point its got to be over. I guess I need to move on.
 
Hey, tell you what, why dont you and I dance tonight? Knowing he crossed the line, he braces for the impact. Jane, staring at her half empty drink, looks up slowly. You know I cant do that. Trying to make light of a situation he cast darkness upon, he perks his voice and says, oh, come on! . Itll be slow and quaint and nothing will go wrong.

	You dont have to do this, the waitress passive aggressively delivered. Its not like Im going to be able to get out of here if I want to.
	She was right. The space society told us that it would become mandatory for all astronauts to take a leave of absence at least once in their lives. We had spent forty nights taking shifts on the ship and were stuck together like glue. Our family helped us bring our things into the house so we could stay with each other. It was an absolute shit show ahead of us. But there was no way we were going to let her go. She was my soulmate. My one true love. And now she was gone. IWhat are you doing in here? I asked. The waitress passive aggressively delivered her nauseating first words to me. You need to get out of here!
 
Why do you keep telling me that? Why dont you just let me go home and stop drinking coffee all the time? You know its not like I have anything better to do with my life... She started giving stipulations, but I could never satisfy her. It was as if she was trying to make me feel guilty for what I had done wrong. We were stuck together like glue when we got sent to space. My family helped us bring up our baby sister who was born a few days after we left Earth. . s room felt like home. It was the only place I could be myself without having to worry about what other people would think of me. We were stuck together like glue for forty nights taking shifts at a coffee shop. My family helped us bring in food and water, but we didnt have much money. The space society told us that it would become mandatory if we stayed longer than forty days. They started giving stipulations: stop drinking coffee when you get home from work, send your mail every second Wednesday, and never use the bathroom again. That was one of the most nauseating first words out of my mouth. . I. We were stuck together like glue for forty nights taking shifts in the same room. My family helped us bring up the kids, but I could never satisfy my sleepy mind with more than a little physical stimulus. The only thing that kept me awake was the fact that there was an absolute shit show ahead of us. It started when we got to the restaurant. The waitress passive aggressively delivered her nauseating first words: Youre going to have to quit drinking coffee.
 
We didnt know what else to say so we just nodded our heads and went on our way. When we arrived at the station, it was pitch black except for the moonlight shining through the window. As soon as we stepped off the ship, the space society told us that we would be required to wear masks all day long. . I.
 
The waitress passive aggressively delivered the nauseating first words, You are going to have to stop drinking coffee and get rid of your bottom shelves...	Oh my god! What am I going to do? How can I live with myself for forty nights taking shifts at a coffee shop? Its not like I had any other choice She trailed off as if she could never satisfy her sleep hungry mind. Well, you see, we dont have much time left on Earth. The space society told us that this would become mandatory in twenty-five years. They started giving stipulations about when we would be able to return home. We were supposed to check our mail every second Wednesday until then. And they said there was an absolute shit show ahead of us. . I, and a few other novelty band stickers. The room felt like home. I could never satisfy my sleepy mind with the little physical stimulus that came from this place. My family helped us bring in some food to eat while we waited for our flight. We spent forty nights taking shifts at the local diner. They started giving stipulations:
 
Stop drinking coffee if you dont drink it every day. You had to check your mail every second Wednesday. It would become mandatory by the end of the year. If you wanted to go back to Earth, you had to do so within twenty-four hours of landing. This was all very hard on both of us, but we stuck together like glue. After forty days, we were finally able to get home. . I.
 
The waitress passive aggressively delivered the news that would become mandatory for us to take shifts in the dorms. What do you mean mandatory? We have forty nights taking shifts and it is not like we are going to be able to get out of here any time soon. The space society told us that if we didnt agree to this, then we would be forced to go through a three-month separation from our loved one forty days after they were born. It was an absolute shit show ahead of us but I know my family helped us bring them into this world. They just needed a little physical stimulus before they started giving stipulations about how their lives should change. For example, stop drinking coffee on Wednesdays because it will make your eyes water. If you want to keep your job, you need to pay more attention to your work. . I.
	The waitress passive aggressively delivered the nauseating first words of her life, You are going to spend forty nights taking shifts at a coffee shop with no one but yourself. You will stop drinking coffee and you will get your mail every second Wednesday from now on. Your family helped us bring you here because they didnt know what else to do. The space society told us that it would become mandatory for anyone who wanted to live in space to have their own place. They started giving stipulations about how long we would be able to stay there. We were supposed to report back to them by 6:00 p.m. each night. This was an absolute shit show ahead of us. . s room felt like home. We spent forty nights taking shifts in the living room, sitting on the couch, and listening to our favorite music. When we were done, we would go down to the dining room and sit for a while before going back to bed. It wasnt long before we started giving stipulations to each other. One of them was that we stop drinking coffee after four days. The other was that I could never satisfy my hunger with more than two glasses of wine at a time. Our family helped us bring up three children; one girl, who is now five years old, and another boy, who will be six next month. My parents also told us that if we did not take care of our loved one forty days from now, it would become mandatory for us to do so. . ",,fake
49,"Im a 28-year-old female, I have deep-set brown eyes and my very short, wavy, black hair is neatly styled. I am recently married, with a kid on the way. I am on the way home from the store. When I looked behind myself I saw a car? Ehh its probably just my imagination. I thought to myself. It was dark outside almost 11 pm. Ow! I exclaimed This child never stops moving! I looked behind myself again. Its still there? I panicked a little and took a picture, it wasnt really good though. When I got home, I went and snuggled with my now-spouse. The next morning, I went out to my part-time job. I think at least. This time I took another picture just to make sure. Its sort of freaking me out. It could be just me overreacting like I said last night it was dark out. Anyway, I got a lot of slack for my job, because I am pregnant. My kid is due on September 23rd! I can't wait! When I got home, My husband RJ was on the couch waiting for me. Honey? he saidYes?Oh! Your home!Well, duh. I started laughing. He moved from his spot on the couch, and walked over to me and spun me around then kissed me! I love you, He murmurs through my hair. I giggle. . stop it! youre tickling me! He moved his face from my head. I was just having some fun, He whispers in a fake whiny voice. That night I decided it would be best to keep this car following me a secret. For now at least. I looked at my sleeping husband and imagined back to when we first met. It was back in high school in 11th grade. I was walking down the hall when I saw RJ coming down the hallway on a skateboard. He screamed out WATCH OUT PRETTY GIRL! I was like ...Huh? BAM he ran into me I fell over OWW! I cried out as my left wrist started aching. He was so tall! . He must if saw the pain in my eyes he dropped my hands I winced again. He looked troubled Are you- I responded with Ami. he continued Ami ok, I got that. Are you ok..? I said Yes, I am fine. and looked away from him and winced again. NO YOURE NOT! he caught me Fine Im not. He grabbed me by my right wrist. And dragged me to the nurses room. After I got out of the nurses room with a bandage. (I sprained my wrist) RJ was pacing back and forth. . He looked at me with big eyes then sort of pushed me off of him then he pulled me back for another kiss. Just kidding that didnt actually happen. It went more like this I let him finish what he was saying. Then he blushed and reached for my hand and was rubbing it like it would feel all better. I looked at him and said, You should have paid more attention. he sighed and said I know, I know and then we became really good friends and eventually became more than just friends Which lead up to dating for 7 years and then being engaged for 4 years then finally got married. The next day, as I was going to work, I saw the same car! I knew it was the same car because of the 2 pictures I had. This time I took a picture of the license plate. . I almost called the cops but decided against it. It probably just my imagination I said to myself for the third time. As I walked into the store a couple of my co-workers came over and said hi we were just casually discussing work. When all a sudden I saw the car again! I started panicking again. The person in the car looked at me. It was a man who looked sort of familiar but I couldnt exactly put my hand on who he was. He realized I saw him and drove very fast away. I went back to talking to the co-workers but realized they were questioning me. . They didnt. Good I thought to myself. They shrugged their shoulders and returned to talking. On my way home I saw the car again! This is getting really creepy! I said to no one in particular. All a sudden I had an urge to pull over. So I pulled over. The car stopped right by me and walked out. Then I realized who it was. It was RJ! He looked at me and I instantly realized, no RJ just looks like him He looked at me and said Finally I got to you!I stepped backward about to run to the car. WAIT! He cried out. I stopped THAT IS RJS CRY! I froze. . That is when I noticed it was his father, Carmen. He looked at me, you figured it out? I started shaking. Carmen what are you doing here, you live hundreds of miles away? He sighed and said, Im not alive anymore I can go where ever I want. I gasped. But if you not alive How are you here He looked at me that moment I realized he was almost floating. He said That isnt important. I looked at him, confused. What do you mean it isnt important! He sighed again Never mind that. I need to warn you, He pointed at my stomach whatever you do, NEVER EVER! . Not until she is at least 16 years old! Why?! I responded I cant I-I-I dont have enough time His eyes grew big and he disappeared. Exactly 3 months later I gave birth to a beautiful young girl! How did he know she was going to be a girl? I said muffled RJ said What did you say? Nothing I responded. . ",,real
