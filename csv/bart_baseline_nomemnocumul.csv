I couldn't take carrying away the countless souls, hardly different from one another, that slaughtered each other by the thousands in pointless wars.

Each one brought me more pain, especially the younger ones ; why humans bring such cruelty that others are compelled to take their own lives rather than using their pain to help others is eternally beyond me.

12,"They dropped acid in their backyard, the California desert. The power at Barkersd gone out, so Charlie and the girls went out and spent the night in the scrub. The arroyos of the scrubland, wolves kickin up dust in the ditches chasing a desert hare, the goddam Solar system spread out above, and a flat boulder, a stone alter to this Bizarro-world version of the Merry Pranksters, to copulate. This was a little over a year before Van recorded Into the Mystic when he was doin Moondance at A&R in New York, but at that moment, this mustve been one of those waves Charlie always claimed he could send out, and Van caught it. Sweaty and buzzed, they set up a bonfire. I am the grass and the lion, the fifth Beatle and the tree Siddhartha sat under. I am the stone wall Bodhidharma stared at for twenty years!
Charlie pointed to a snake with a rattler on its tip winding along just past the fire light. See that Sidewinder? . The hippie chicks nodded, right on. Tex knocked over his beer bottle and picked it up. Charlie broke down the lyrics to Revolution 9. Its all right there, man, John, Paul, George and Ringo all know whats up. Yeah, man, sure, Tex nods along. When their backs to the wall 
With less people, less pollution, man. Clean water, healthy airAl Gore was with them in spirit, Im sure. They were livin it, The Electric Acid Kool-Aid Test, they were livin it; Tom Wolfe, Ken Kesey, Owsley Stanley. What Thomas Pynchon spent the rest of his life catchin up to. What Jerry Garcia never let go of. . You could say: Well, it was Woodstock, Altamont Freeway, Kent State, or Easy fuckin well, we blew it Rider, but the surf was already crashin, and Charlie risin outta that seas what finally broke it. Ha Ha. They told each other horror stories, huddlin and gropin and imaginin a boogeyman Nixon stalkin out there in the night, grazin the brush just past the bonfire, checkin under your bed and in your rectal cavity; and the specter of Reagan, even farther away, so far away as to be impossible, just a clown on a screen, no way, couldnt happen. He couldnt happen. . Totally. How you gonna go out, man? How you gonna go? You gonn say: Dont kill me, Im worth more to you alive than dead!? or you gonna go Go ahead. Youll only be killin a man.? Charlie grilled Tex, his American Rasputin eyes--the same eyes bootlicking honkies would be scared to death of hypnotizing a jury in a years time--burrowing into him. Tex swallowed, unsure. Eichmanns and pigs, Tex, Eichmanns and pigs. 
Sure, Charlie, sure. Whatever you say. 
Having fun. They were all having fun. . Susan, Mary and all the rest. We had fun, didnt we? somebody murmurs in the silence. Maybe Squeaky. They got barbed wires and gas chambers, we got tye-dye and Brian Wilson. 
Tex finishes another brown bottle and belches: The blue bus is callin us. Driver where you takin us? 
This gets celebratory laughs, a round of applause. Glass shatters against a log as Tex chucks the empty at the bonfire. Lights flash out there, in the even more deserted desert. They watch them for a while. Greens and blues, and a red one too. The greens and blues fade. . Some doze off. The yipping of the coyotes brings them to, then a few moments later their heads slump forward again. Charlies head tilts over at an odd angle; A cold gaze meets the fire. In my minds eye, my thoughts light fires in your cities. 
Whatd you say, Charlie? 
Ya coulda called Mein Kampf sloppy, but theres one thing you cant deny: Its a thought that lit the world on fire. All ideas, in due time. 
Sure. I dig. 
Heh heh, when we get through, whos even gonna know we were here? Im not even here, man. . And theyll know who its from. And the Georrings and Bormanns will call them retards and gas them. Theyd try to do the same to me, if I werent not there. 
I get ya. Its likeJosef Mengele will never die, right? Because they keep him alive. One day, theyre even gonna adopt his methods. Youll see. 
They sat there a long time. Where do we go from here?, a voice asks from the dark. The chick from Valley of the Dolls got pregnant. Charlie kept the hits comin. Susan got a brain tumor and Squeakys Colt jammed. The power was back up and running when they reached the shack at sunrise.

13,"A yellow vintage car stopped in front of a huge, old but beautiful mansion, and Ava Brown stepped out of its backseat. Dressed in an orange, knee-length crepe dress, her hair bouncing off her shoulders, she walked towards a tall man in an office suit. You must be Miss Ava Brown, The man offered his hand for a handshake. Ava took it graciously. And you must be Mr. Wilson, Ava didnt know his first name and thought it was none of her business to ask for it, Glad to meet you.
 
She followed Wilson inside the house through its pointed arched front door. She had already seen it in photos, but it was much more elegant in real. With its red and brown bricks, and surprisingly satisfactory condition, it was all she had imagined and more. Wilson stopped and made an awkward face. Well, actually He began, it was renovated a bit. Some parts of it. A few years back. I mean, it is a very old building you know.
Oh! Ava was visibly surprised, I wasnt told that. Never mind!
 
Wilson led her into the main hall. It had a small little fireplace, just like she had read in novels. And there was one big window, also arched, but not the pointed kind. She went to it and held the fabric of the maroon curtains tied to either end of it. How old are these curtains? She asked Wilson, although it felt like a stupid question at that time. . This place has been abandoned for the last ten years and before that, it belonged to a Mr. Trent, and before that God knows.
Ava was disappointed but she realized it could be difficult to know the exact history of a gothic mansion in a place where there were many gothic mansions. She continued to feel the curtain between her fingers. They were so soft and silky
But then she felt something else on it, something hard, crusty. When she looked closely, she saw the maroon of it was darkened at some spots, almost brown. Like blood. Blood! Mr. Wilson! She took a step back, alarmed, Is thisIs this blood?
Wilson came to where she was standing and adjusted his glasses on his slightly crooked nose. . Maybe somebody got slightly wounded or somethingmany many years ago.
Does blood remain intact on thesesurfacesfor many many years? Ava asked. Any sight of blood, even if it was dried, always made her anxious. I suppose, Wilson said and then turned around, We have other rooms to examine. Please follow, Miss Brown.
 
They walked into the library next. Gigantic shelves, lined with leatherbound books, hid the walls. Ava walked over to one of the shelves and picked out a book, which turned out to be a diary. The words Jack Trent were inscribed on top of it. Mr. Wilson? She called, but Wilson had apparently left the room. . She opened Mr. Trents diary. Much to Avas surprise, the diary was scribbled with poetry, some of it quite excellent, some of it a bit trashy, some of it incomplete. She smiled at the idea of this unknown Mr. Trent being a poet. Most of the pages in between were empty, and the last few were again filled with poetry. She wondered why Mr. Trent must have skipped so many pages. Also, there was something different about these last few poems. The handwriting was changed, and the poems had taken a darker route in terms of themes. There was mention of death and ruin and ghosts
 
Ava kept the diary back where it had been and went out of the room. She still couldnt find Wilson. . Mr. Wilson? She called again. No response. She went outside. It was night-time already. The sky was without a moon, or at least she couldnt see one, with all the tall trees towering over the area. She switched on her flashlight. No Wilson. Her car was still in the driveway. She started walking towards it. Panic and anger struggled to take over her mind. She was angry with Wilson for abandoning her, and she was panicking for a lot of reasons, some of which she herself couldnt comprehend. Why would Wilson just leave her there? Or was there something else going on? Something happened and she fell face-first on the ground. Must be a rock, She said to herself. . She looked closely at the soil, suddenly thankful for the flashlight. She touched the huge red spot on the otherwise dull brown land. It felt wet. It was fresh. Fresh blood. Was it here before? She tried to recall. Her brain wasnt helping at all. She got up on her feet and ran. Towards the car. It was best to leave the place. She would inquire about Wilsons whereabouts once she reached home. She twisted the key and the engine roared to life. Finally, some relief! She began driving outwards. There were huge apple trees on one side of the road, and tall green grass on the other. Ava didnt know how long shed been driving. An hour? Two hours? . When she looked in the rear-view mirror, there was only dead grass to be seen. She was too afraid to pull over. The last thing she saw was a sudden bright flash of light blinding her. There was a crash, and her head hit the steering wheel. And then, everything went blank. . ",,real

15,"I dont have very many memories of my early childhood. A flash here, a picture there, maybe even the sound of our dog barking down the hallway. I do remember things like that. But I also remember other things. My moms voice, the sound of our radio in the kitchen, my own high-pitched giggle. These things still exist in the dark, almost imperceptible corners of my mind, seeming to lurk far away from every other thought that runs through my busy brain during the course of my day. I could be working with one of my students, solving a problem, chatting with my supervisor, and for some reason, the image of my dad sleeping in our old recliner will make its way to the forefront. Its an odd thing. Everyone tells me that its so. And maybe theyre right; maybe its not normal. But sometimes, I think about it, and it becomes funny; I have a memory from so, so long ago, and yet I forget take my medication in the morning, or I dont remember what I had for dinner the previous evening. Talk about irony. But I have one particular memory that I will never be able to shake from my mind. Something that has stuck with me from the time I was two to now, at age twenty-three. I remember everything about that morning. I remember how bright the morning sun was. How it shone through the windows of our living room, decorating the nearby wall in radiant rays of yellow and white. I remember placing my tiny hand on it, fascinated by the dark shadow that it cast. . Our tiny apartment had a carpeted living room, which I suppose was good for me. I was clumsy, and found myself falling over a lot, but the carpet would provide some cushioning so I wouldnt get hurt. I often sat in front of the television, watching Teletubbies, or maybe some cartoon show. I remember that La-La was my favorite of the Teletubbies; she seemed so bright and bubbly and happy, and her name was musical. I also remember my parents. My dad, a pastor with a love for God and Oreos, and my mom, a new teacher with a passion for learning that she would pass on to me, one day. I remember them both there that morning. My mom was in the kitchen, probably drinking her morning coffee, and my dad in his recliner, reading a newspaper with the television on in the background. . I remember seeing what had to be a school bus driving by the apartment. I was much too young for school at that time, and probably didnt really know what a school bus was. But the flash of yellow in the window with big black words printed on the side all but confirms it for me now. I remember my dad looking up from his paper, and his face clouding over underneath his thick glasses. But he wasnt looking at me, or the window, or the door. His eyes were glued to the television. I remember him reaching for the remote, possibly to turn up the volume. He called out, I assume, for my mom, and she appeared mere moments later. She soon had the same gaze upon her face that my dad did. I remember her picking me up, sitting down on the couch, and cradling me close to her. . They seemed upset. Why were they upset? Was it because of me? I remember wrapping my entire hand around two of my moms fingers, and the smell of her lilac-scented moisturizer making its way into my nose. That was something she had always loved: the scent of lilacs. To this day, she still does. I remember hearing my parents talking to one another in worried tones. I dont know what they were saying. But something was desperately wrong. They continued to watch the television, and I remember the reporter. She seemed to be around my moms age, and her voice was heavy with distress. She talked and talked, barely stopping to take a breath, and images flashed behind her. I remember seeing the smoke. The fires. The frantic people. . I was too young to understand what was happening, or where, or how, or why. But I found myself watching the broadcast, right along with my parents, and knowing in the back of my mind that something was not right. I remember hearing screaming and wailing. Where was it coming from? What had happened? Would we have to leave, escape whatever disaster was unfolding? I expected that we would, but there we sat. My mom was rigid with fear; she had stopped playing with me at that point, and was wholly fixated on the broadcast. The woman on T.V. continued to talk, conveying a sense of dread and urgency. And the action continued on a separate screen; something had crashed, somewhere. And people were hurt. . I was a child, not even three years old. I remember that we sat there for a long time. At one point, I stopped watching, and my mind became occupied elsewhere. But my parents didnt move; they sat in silence, horrified at what they were witnessing. I remember feeling angry that my mom wouldnt play with me again. At the time, I didnt understand why. And I remember that when they finally did begin to move and talk again, my mom wouldnt let me out of her sight. She stayed with me for the whole day, and she took longer to tuck me in that night than she usually did, and hugged me a little tighter. I had put the entire situation out of my mind, but clearly, she had not. Now, as an adult, I understand what I remember. . I was so innocent to the ways of the world; I never thought about the reality of violence and the finality of death. I didnt understand. Now that Ive grown up a lot more, Ive become all too familiar with those concepts, and I wish I could go back to the time when I had no cares, no worries, no fears. When I would just sit on the floor, playing with my toys or shoving Cheerios into my mouth. But its not that easy. Every so often, I look back at that time, and I envy my younger self for not having the option to suffer through the gruesome realities of September 11th. But I will always remember it. . ",,real

The priest lifted his chin and glared upon him. `` You have angered the gods for the last time, Argoth of the beast clan! '' `` Says who! '' He exclaimed.

They looked up as well, waiting expectantly for a bolt of lightning or the rumble of thunder. The silence was deafening.

18," Excuse me, you said you  re where now?  Rui blinks, matching the pace of the cursor on her screen, waiting patiently for her to fill in the information for the Rangers.  Well, I  m not exactly sure to be honest Miss.  A check of the Trainer ID had told her that it was a newer trainer, a Shiroishi Yuu, who had only graduated trainer school two weeks previously. A glance over the page tells Rui that Yuu is only thirteen, failed trainer school three times before he graduated, and had an Ekans registered as his starter.  Could you describe the place for me, Shiroishi-san?  Rui attempts and the young trainer gives a small laugh.  Yuu, I like Yuu.     Well then Yuu, can you describe where you are again and how you got there?  Rui waits, waving her hand in the air to get her superior over to her desk. Otsuka-san walks over, holding his steaming cup of tea and looks curious until Rui puts the child on speakerphone.  I was exploring around into Mount Moon and I keep finding these guys in black and they won  t leave me alone.  There  s a short silence.  I  m glad Hebi, Taddy, and Speary are doing good but there  s a lot of them.  Rui looks up at Otsuka-san in confusion.  I just kinda wan na leave. Can someone guide me out? .  Rui attempts to get clarified.  And some girls. Something about being on some sort of team. I dunno, my Pokemon are getting tougher fighting them so I wasn  t paying any attention.  Rui looks at the Trainer card for Yuu again. Here was a thirteen year old fighting, and apparently winning, against what sounded like Team Rocket.  I just lost track of where I was walking and I don  t know where I am now. Can you get me out of here?  Otsuka-san pats Rui on the shoulder, shrugging.  Just guide him out. We  ll send the police in the check the situation later.  Otsuka-san whispers and Rui nods, returning the call to her headset. . Her manager stays beside her, sipping at his tea, and listening.  All right Yuu. What was the last sign you remember seeing?     Um I dunno. I think it said something about cruel leaning.  Rui  s face twitches at the answer. The kid could take out a bunch of Rockets but couldn  t read a sign?  Is it possible that it said Cerulean? C, e, r, u, l, e, a, n?     Yeah! Cruel lean.  Rui wants to put her face in her hands as she hears Otsuka-san snort in laughter. Instead, she forces a smile onto her face and stuffs it into her voice. . Is there any way you can get back to that sign?     It was like a floor up.  Rui pulls up the most current map for Mount Moon on her computer, blocking out Yuu  s Trainer card. She locates the sign she thinks he  s talking about and tries to figure out where the child might  ve gone from there.  So you headed downward then.  She trails off as Yuu gives a joyful affirmative.  Which direction did you turn from the ladder?     I went right.  Yuu hums a little.  Like with my back to the ladder, right?     Exactly how I want you to think about it. .  Rui smiles. The kid is closer to the exit than he thinks he is.  That  s fantastic news, Yuu. If you  ve continued straight ahead, there  s a large cavern. Follow the left edge of that cavern and you  ll find another path.  Yuu hums along, indicating he  s still alive and receiving directions as he walks. Rui slowly guides him out of the dark cave, with a minor interruption at the exit of someone wishing to battle. He stays on the phone throughout the battle though, unwilling to hang up.  Ah! I see daylight!  He gives a loud shout and Rui listens to Yuu running along the path.  Fresh air! .  You  re safely outside then, Yuu?     Oh yeah! I think I can see the city in the distance!  An amused smile appears on Rui  s face. The child trainer certainly . ",,real

Almost silently, I said, I cant do this anymore. Its too hard for me to live without you. Youre a horrible person! And with that, I walked out of the kitchen and into the living room. As I sat down on the couch, my usual strain thought crossed my mind: What if I die? What if I end up in prison or something? That would end much worse than what I am going through right now. Maybe I should just stop crying every time I think about you. Do you have any tissues?Holding my breath, I let tears flow back from my eyes. The next morning, I woke up at 5:30 AM. My alarm was set for 6:00 AM. 
 
Holding my breath, I stood completely shocked. You are such a horrible person! I said in disbelief. He let out the nastiest giggle possible and turned to walk away from me. As he walked away, an unusual thought ran across my mind. What if this wasnt some kind of prank? Could it be something more serious? Something that would end much worse than what had already happened? This was not going to go well at all. The next morning, as usual, I woke up with a start. My alarm went off just like every other morning. It was 6:00 am. How could I have slept so peacefully without any interruptions? No matter how many times I tried to fall back into a peaceful sleep without any interruption, nothing seemed to work. . 
 
Almost silently, I said, I dont know what to do. My words were interrupted by the loudest giggle I had heard in a long time. It was so loud that it shook the whole house. The door of my room swung open and there stood my mother with her face buried in her hands. Her eyes were red and she was crying every time she looked at me. What are you doing here? She asked as she tried to shake off the tears from her eyes. You have to leave! I yelled out angrily. At this point, I could no longer control myself anymore. I let tears flow back down my face like they always did when I was upset. And then an annoyance thought crossed my mind. .

As I looked at the scene before me, I could not help but laugh out loud. A few seconds later, I heard the most disgusting giggle possible. And just like that, everything went black.

A rather annoying thought crossed my mind at that very moment. This would end much worse than any nightmare I had ever experienced.

There is no way I am going to live with this domestic abuse another morning. How could I have been so stupid? .    You are a horrible person! I shrieked. She let out the nastiest giggle possible.

What if this is all some sort of dream? It would end much worse than it started. We reached the main entrance door that led into the living room.

I stood completely shocked for a few seconds before turning around and running out of the house. As soon as I reached the main entrance door, I turned on the lights and ran down the stairs.

28,"**Prelude : **  `` Brujeria, '' they said, looking about the landscape as they said it. `` The one you seek is Brujeria. `` Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut. But speak to no one of your visit. '' Agueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die. Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca wasn't working. The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her. But they could not make her well again. Agueda was desperate. Agueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river. She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared. Agueda didn't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked. She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame. Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite. She took another bite, and another. Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured. `` It tastes good, yes? '' A voice said behind her. She jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught. . However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground. Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda. `` No use for me now. You take it, you finish it. '' Agueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish's meat near the tail. The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing. It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. . `` I'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry.... ''  `` The spirits told me, '' the Brujeria said, interrupting. `` And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought. '' As Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. `` Yes, I do. '' Replied the Brujeria. . `` Again, they told me. The Ayuhuasca does not work, they said. These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the the spirits that house them. Drink this. '' Agueda looked to the fire that the Brujeria had pointed to and saw a makeshift pot with a brew boiling. It was Ayuhuasca, but it smelled different than the ones that the village shamans prepared. This boiled with a certain glow to it, and it smelled sweeter. Was this an attempt to steal her energy? Her mother had always warned her about the dangerous Brujos that wanted nothing more than the life force of the ones that drank before them. `` I am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child, '' said the old woman. . I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages. Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair. So I stay here, for their sake, not just my own. '' Agueda looked at the book that the elder produced on her lap. The book was as tattered as the rags that she was wearing, but there was no mistaking that the air around this book brought a certain chill to her bones that the fire could hardly warm. Could this woman be the Warlock of Chiloe? Agueda once heard stories of the power of this . ",,real

A concrete passage, left behind from the civilizations of the days of old, upon which we structure our society. It is measurable in distance and depth and width, in temperature and pressure. But no one can tell you the way the walls breathe. They say it's a rite of passage, that everyone does it when it's their time. But nobody ever comes out unchanged. The first step is easy. The second too. You can hear your friends and family, still encouraging you on repeat in the back of your mind. Your thoughts are optimistic and you're headed towards adulthood. After some time, the tunnel is a little more foreboding. Darkness shrouds the walls with its thin wispy fingers. The cheers in your head have died down. If you turn around now, you could still see the light of day behind you. But you do not dare look back. Looking back only makes the trek forward more difficult, you will be drawn like a moth to the light, even if you don't know it. This is the point the mind dips. The tunnel continues on, past your view, it's own horizon of empty abyss. Your footsteps echo around you off of the cold, unforgiving cement. . The tunnel converges slightly as you walk. It isn't small, per say, but the ceiling is low and the sides are narrow, your head may graze the concrete now and again, your shoulders are cramped uncomfortably tight. The shadows hang from the concrete in inky pools and cling to any surface that passes through. Perhaps now you consider heading back, calling it quits, and trying again some other time. The entrance is but a blemish of light on the face of darkness. But for some reason you continue. The darkness is heavy now. You can *feel* it. Dragging you in. Swallowing you. Devouring everything. Behind you, the tunnel ends in a pinprick of white hope. You pause momentarily. Nothing can prepare you for absolute darkness. Nothing. . You may have even closed your eyes and sat in silence inside. Maybe you can't see your hand inches from your face. This is the point the mind bends. You take another step forward. The light on the horizon behind you winks away, or rather, the darkness opens its eye. Your footstep echoes all around you. This is no longer a game. With each breath, you exhale hope. You close your eyes. You open them. You can't tell the difference. You belong to the tunnel now. Even worse, you would expect silence here. You stand still, hold your breath. The tunnel whispers to you. The wind laughs. Your heart is chasing you through the dark, and gaining fast. Time is nonexistent here. The blackness surrounds you entirely. Maybe you scream, maybe you don't. You can't hear it anyways. You stumble through the darkness. You can't tell where you end and the tunnel begins. This is the point the mind breaks. . ",,real

The tiny shop began raking in a great big pinch behind the counter as they sold their wares. If you were lucky enough to find a little bit of craft chewing tobacco at a local council meeting, you 'd be able to get your hands on a decaf caramel chewachino from one of these pokey little tobacconists. And if you didn't have any luck, you could always pick up some old-fashioned Marlboro's and give them away for free. In fact, Michael Andrews never thought he  d see his favourite caffinated beverages becoming extinct overnight. Nobody could brew tea anymore, nobody could smoke cigarettes, and nobody could even make a decent cup of coffee. . ",,fake

A dark blue minivan pulled up in front of the house. It's front end shrunken and its hood was gone. `` Fire truck! '' Henry yelled as he ran out of the car. As soon as he saw the van, he knew it was going to be his last day. He could hear people talking on the other side of the street.

39,"Time and friendship
 
They say that time heals and erases everything. I experienced situations that I thought were very remarkable and today I only have the trace of such memories. Some of these tracks make me doubt the time, others make me grateful. No, time does not erase all wounds. He passes. And sometimes we need it to process the damage. Measure trauma. Although today I am aware of its importance, I have always mocked this old saying. When I was 14, my best friend, Felipe, lost his mother. It was a heavy blow for a 15-year-old boy to endure, having his younger sister to look after and a father who was never around. I started spending a lot of time at your house after that. I felt the need to stay near and provide support. He didn't know how to play. I was not a good teacher. We spent the whole night playing and talking about things other than life. We woke up the next morning and I left. I don't remember very well, but I had an appointment. There were no smartphones or accessible internet so I could check on him, so I spent the afternoon there again. I have been there many times for many days. Time did help. But the wound is still there. We grow together in the years to come. When I turned 18, I moved out of my folks house. I started a relationship that didn't quite work out and went to live in another country. Felipe went to another city, but still, close to the city where we grew up. We started to study and, month after month, our contact diminished. . But the vicissitudes of life are like that. At 23, with a voice already closer to that of a trained adult, again out of a complicated relationship, I decided to return to my home for a while. My parents welcomed me very well, as they always did. We had a barbecue, called all the family, and celebrated my return. Living with my parents and siblings was very complex, as I was just coming home. Full of new habits. It was a lot to process, I think. For me, it certainly was, because I was no longer used to living with them. Although my contact with Felipe was rare, our friendship was apparently intact. We talked one of these days and had the following dialogue:
 
 Hello, Popoto? (Popoto is his childhood nickname, dont bother about it). .  Ah, you know, living life as usual. I am living with my parents again. Things are not going so well. But everything is quiet now.  Hey, why don't you come live with me? I'm thinking of renting a bigger house because of the dogs, if you want, just come.  He said.  Seriously?  I said with a frown, the hand that didn't hold the phone starting to drum while I considered the proposal.  Sure. And so it was. In less than a month I had arranged everything to move to another city, with a little more privacy from my parents. All right, all good. Up to page two. We had no money for almost anything and worked in bars to pay rent and bills. . So I decided that we would hold down the fort together. Felipe is a cook, bartender, and waiter, but he studied to be a programmer. And he was a great programmer, but like me, he has no structure for the formal market. Corporate pressure destroys our will to live, but you have to experience it, so you know how it is. I work as a copywriter and as a columnist. Money is not good, since I am not so good myself. But he knew how to wash a cup and serve a table. The work flowed. The feeling was that our friendship got even stronger with all the problems that we were overcoming. When we arrived at the new house, for example, we had no internet, cupboards, refrigerator, stove and no bed. Luckily the water and electricity were turned on in time, but our first days were very peculiar. . Two friends living in a house, alone and ready to take over the world. Isn't that how we see youth in the movies? Well, whoever writes these films, chooses not to portray the details in the care of a home. Incredibly, we managed to smudge a house without furniture, after all, we also didn't have brooms, cloths, and squeegees. The first time we went to clean up the dogs shit in the yard, we used a newly purchased hose to help make the job easier.  Bring me the detergent, will you? - I remember as if it were yesterday from this question that Felipe asked me.  Which one?  Exactly, which detergent? We hadn't bought a second package.  Are you serious? - His incredulity left me incredulous. .  We bought ONE bottle. Acctually, no not really, I picked one up at my folks when I was packing my suitcase to come, we need to buy things.  It was obvious that we needed it. Felipe's already sullen countenance has become even more dismal. In the days that followed, we already had two mattresses, for each of our rooms. We bought a second-hand table and 3 chairs (so we already had a place to sit, eat, play, study, watch TV, and rest. Life was good. We asked for the internet on the first day at the house, since normally the first payment is only made in the second month. It is no news that they arrived just after 5 or 6 days and many complaints. . Felipe was working during the day these days, so I had to solve these issues alone since I was still looking for work. The internet arrived and we were able to start looking for more jobs online, which is our expertise. We evolved a lot, we were children and soon we became adults. Responsibilities, precautions, savings, and health concerns. The marks of aging. We talked a lot, every night. The themes were the most diverse.  But what if we started to exchange letters so that in the future, someone compiles with our dialogues?  Yes, an idea like that could only come from a younger self. Dreamy, self-centered, and ambitious. I am still all those things, but now I have a little more sense of life and things. We both dream of being famous fantasy writers to this day. . It's a great idea. Too bad we live in the same house.  His playful smile is still the same that amuses me currently in our video calls. For reasons that we know and at the same time we do not, I went to live again in another country. An opportunity appeared and I reached the road. Felipe needed roots, I needed wings. But fear not, each of us reached both roots and wings, on our own time. My relationship with Felipe was a little shaken when I decided to leave. I moved back to Brazil and was ready to move back in with Felipe when I met the woman of my life. He also lives with his girlfriend these days, just like me. My period living with Felipe seems timeless. It was one of the most intense and fun periods of my life. We had some incompatibilities of living together, sure. As every family has. . ",,real
40,"The morning dawned cold and bright over the valley. As the sun crested over the western hill, it illuminated a lone knight, the formidable and intimidating Sir Mason, on horseback, his red and gold bear crest stark against the cloudless skies. The bear knights soldiers emerged behind him, the sun to their backs, creating one solid silhouette of impending warfare.Gallant and beloved Sir Noah, on the eastern hill, blinked against the rising sun. His army stood at his back, silently menacing, an array of soldiers and mounted cavalry, each wearing his green and silver heraldry. Two great and shaggy wolves slavered beside him, eager for battle.Each knight rode purposefully and unattended to the center of the valley which was delineated by thick, black tape. Those are the rules.He rushed his horse to the line, stopping almost face-to-face with the wolf knight.Sir Noah led his horse back over the tape with a rude gesture. The mighty armies stood  atop the opposite hills, silent, each knights respective banners waving in the breeze.Sir Mason flipped open his visor and looked at Sir Noahs limping nag of a steed in disdain. My horse is much cooler.Hey! Noah pulled the plastic helmet off his head and looked in dismay at his frayed old stick horse. Masons stick horse was newer and wasnt missing an eye. . The Queen demands that we settle our differences, and unite our lands once more.She knows not what she asks of us, Sir Noah responded, unceremoniously plopping his helmet back into place.Nevertheless, we must come to an agreement as gentlemen, or we will suffer dire consequences.I spit at your notion of gentlemancy, Sir Mason.Mason jumped back in horror. Did you just spit on the floor? Im telling Mom!No, wait, Ma-Mom! Noahs spitting!The Queens footsteps echoed strangely through the valley as she approached. She appeared as if from nowhere, inserting herself between the two brave knights. . And weve talked about this, Noah. No spitting in the house.Ugh, this is a battlefield, Mom, Noah whined.She sighed. Just hurry it up, and come downstairs to help me with dinner.The Queen departed the battlefield as quickly as she had arrived.Our armies grow restless, Sir Noah.Perhaps it is time for us to truly settle our dispute as the Queen suggests.Sir Mason nodded solemnly. Admit that you ate more than your share of the pizza rolls, Sir Noah.Then you must admit that you drank the last soda again without offering to share it.I shall not.I shall not admit to any wrongdoing either.Sir Mason shook his head and lowered his visor. . Taste my steel, knave!Thats a brontosaurus.Mason grimaced at the blue plastic dinosaur in his hands. Yeah, well, you broke my sword last week, and this is what I could find.Noah pulled out the plastic cutlass from last years pirate costume. You would have broken mine if you could find it.He pointed the sword at Masons chest.Very well. Have at thee, scoundrel!The knights flew into combat that would be sung about for generations by bards and pretty tavern wenches. Fire sparked off their swords as the blades collided over and over. Sir Mason was the stronger knight, that was clear, but Sir Noah was clever and quick.The armies cheered and rushed down the hills to join the battle. . A lone priest, modestly clad in a fuzzy brown robe, approached their duel with his hands in the air.He raised his holy symbol to catch the attention of the dauntless knights, and, with a mighty swing, Sir Noah cleaved the hapless priest in two.You ripped out Mr. Bears stuffing! cried Mason, picking the ruined teddy bear off the floor.I thought he was attacking.He was a member of the clergy and should have been spared the horrors of war. Thats just good manners.Then you shouldnt have thrown him over the line.Noah readjusted his stick horse and straightened his spine.Your priest should never have ventured onto the battlefield. . Such diabolical behavior will not be tolerated in this realm.He dismounted and gave his steed a meaty swat on the flank, sending it away from the battle.Sir Noah shook his head and said,We shall settle this like men, then.He jumped down from his horse and shoved the one-eyed nag back towards the eastern hill.Before Sir Noah could take a fighting stance, Sir Mason tackled him to the ground.Get off, youre on my side of the room!Screw your side, Mason said venomously as he sunk his fist into Noahs stomach. You murdered Mr. Bear on purpose.Oof! Noah gasped, the air almost knocked out of him. He pushed Mason off him to sit up and started sobbing.Mason stood up quickly. . Why have my knights not sorted out their land dispute? she demanded.Sir Noah stayed on the ground in tears while Sir Mason ran over to the Queen to beg forgiveness.Mom, Noah killed Mr. Bear!Well, Mason drowned Admiral Wolfington in the toilet last week, and now hes punched me, Noah wheezed, clutching his stomach and trying his best to look pitiful.Their mom threw up her hands. Boys, for Petes sake. Clean up this mess, and come downstairs to help.But- protested Mason.No buts, she responded. Dont come crying to me about your endless fights unless theres blood. And get that tape off the floor.She turned to Mason. . No. No one goes out the window. Is that understood?Yes, maam, they agreed.The Queen looked around at the once peaceful valley, now strewn with the debris of war. My loyal and stalwart knights, she began, I trust that you will acknowledge a peace this day, for I require your services at the castle.Sir Mason looked at Sir Noah and nodded. The two brave knights shook hands, swearing to put aside their rivalry and reunite their lands and armies as was right and just. At least for tonight. . ",,real

In the early morning leading up to the opening of the store, there was always a young man wanting coffee. He would invariably stop at the counter and order his usual cup of joe. While he was waiting for his drink, he would see an old lady with her face covered in dust. She wore a white blouse and black slippers. Her hair was tied into a messy ponytail. Excuse me maam? I.

Her job was to keep every facility of the quarters in good working condition and ensure that all charges like electricity etc were paid on time. In order to do this, she had to get lower order functionaries to approve submitted proformas. One such person was Mr. Ramchandani who worked as a ceiling fan regulator at the Government Quarter.

'' I provided the address. She sounds unperturbed by this. Fifteen minutes later, the police arrives. I place my right hand on my head, letting my left hand stay in my wife's body. ***   It's been twenty years. I wait for my execution date. Many things come out of my hand as I dream. Shovels, pickaxes, cakes, poisonous snakes one day when I dreamt of dying in a snake pit like Ragnar Lothbrok. My country enjoys making their convicts suffer, and so is my mental state. But one day, I feel the soft caress of Maisarah. . She asked me about directional derivatives, and I tell her all I know. Soon we tell each other a lot of things. A few flashes later, I know her, biblically. `` Husain, when your hand is my heart, you must know, I am forgiving you. '' I smiled at her sweet words. Our hands are holding each other. I do not realise that my eyes have opened. There she is, lying on top of me, naked and beautiful, as the day before she died at my hands. `` AAAAHHHHHH!!! '' I shouted, shoving her off. My shouts grow louder and louder. What is happening? Why is she here? Why can't I die yet? Who am I? ***   The guard on that day recounted what he saw. . She had no identification with her. But her memories matched 100 % with the victim of the homicidal case that the man will be executed for. The case that is well closed, had to be reopened. The case is very odd, and both the former judge residing on the case, and the new judge appointed, can't agree whether Husain is really guilty of not. The High King, having heard of this news, grant him a pardon on account of the abnormal circumstances of the case, and after being proven that he could magically bring things by his hands, and not have it by sleepwalking or sleepstealing. As for my father, Husain, he is a senile gibbering . ",,real
46,"`` Get out. '' I looked up from the chicken breast that I was inspecting to see a rather ugly man looking back. A sheen of grime and sweat coated his hairy arms, and the rest of him was covered by an apron and long white pants. He wore a far too small for him arm band that was probably an attempt to cover a theft mark, but I didn't really care. `` Excuse me? '' `` Get out. '' `` I just want to... ''   `` Now. '' *she screamed as she died*   My hand instinctively went to my neck, the left side, expecting to feel the soft touch of my scarf, but I only felt skin. It was small, like all sin marks, symmetrically jagged, and contained a tiny circle in the center. It meant one thing. Murder. *it was all my fault*   `` Please let me just... ''   *I didn't want this to happen*   The man pulled out a gun and aims at my head. I flashed back to a news report of a murder-marked being shot and killed while trying to enter a casino. The following court case had determined that the killer, a middle aged patron of the casino, to be in the right. This decision was supported by the lack of a mark on said patron, so it was decreed that murdering murderers was completely moral. I raised my hands above my head, and slowly backed away. The man walked with me, coming closer with every stride. . The man did not like this. `` Who are you winking at? '' he shouted, `` Who is with you? '' `` Nobody, '' I answered. *I swear I didn't trip her*   Wrong answer. `` You liar! You fucking lying bitch! '' *I didn't mean to trip her*   I had two options, I could either stand with my hands above my head and risk being shot, or I could run and risk being shot. I chose the latter. There was a loud sound and my right shoulder exploded with pain. I stumbled, but didn't fall. I could feel monumental pain pulsing directly from my shoulder to my brain, but nothing below that. My right arm was a heavy deadweight, pulling me to one side as I ran and causing me to barely dodge the next shot. . The world was slowing down, and I could feel and see everything around me. I had felt this before, a long time ago. *the fire burned my back*   Another explosion of pain, this one near my spine. All of my muscles disconnected from my consciousness, and I collapsed, a convulsing screaming mess. *you have sinned they told me*   The world around me shuddered to a stop. I could see   *her*   *did I sin*   *she shook her head*   *they wronged you*   My convulsions became twitches. *not fair*   *Not Fair*   *NOT FAIR*   My twitches ceased. *nothing is fair* . ",,real
47,"s opponent offered softly. I dont think so, Death replied with a smile. The numbers stopped blinking for a moment as Death sat down on the edge of the bed. He looked at his hands folded together in front of him. His face was pale and he had dark circles under his eyes that made it difficult to tell if he was crying or not. It was hard to tell because there were no tears falling from his eyes. This was the last time he would be able to say one last sentence before passing away. s opponent offered softly. I have no idea, Death said with a slight smile. The numbers stopped blinking for a moment as Death looked at his opponent. His eyes were wide and he was looking down at the floor in front of him. He seemed to be seeing something peculiar about this place. Something that had never been seen before. . s opponent offered softly. You know, it would be quite lovely.
 
Death scanned the room again, seeing something peculiar in the numbers. He turned his head to see what was going on. The numbers stopped blinking and were replaced with a blank screen. Death looked at the blank screen for a moment before turning back to face his opponent. His opponent had been looking at the empty space where the numbers should have been. It was as if he could see the number of people who had died upon impact. However, there was no amount of time that death allowed him to think about such things. There was only one thing left to do: say one last sentence. And so Death did. . s opponent offered softly. I dont know what to say, Death replied as he took a sip of his coffee. He looked around the room, seeing something peculiar. The numbers stopped blinking in front of him. They were still there, but they were not moving. Something was wrong with them. It was almost as if they were trying to figure out how to live without each other. . s opponent offered softly. I dont think so, Death replied. The numbers stopped blinking for a moment as Death let out a long sigh. He sat back down on his chair and folded his hands folded together in front of him. His eyes were fixed on the clock that hung above him. It was seven oclock in the morning. There was no time to waste now. Time to say one last sentence before he died. . s opponent offered softly. I am sorry, but I cant help it. It is the nature of our relationship.
 
But why? The opponent asked. Death paused for a moment and then said, Because you are cheating on me with someone else. That is not something that should be happening in this world. Your actions were unforgivable. You have no right to cheat on me. If you could just say one last sentence to me before I die, please do so. Please dont lie to me again. Tell me who cheated on you. What was your name? Who did you marry? Tell me what happened after you died. Do you know anything about my family? My friends? . s opponent offered softly. I dont know what to say.
 
Oh forget it, his opponent answered sharply. He stood up and walked towards the door. Death followed him as he made his way down the hall. As he approached the door, he noticed that there was no sign of anyone else in the room. The numbers stopped blinking on the wall. There was nothing but a silence between them. After a few moments, Death asked, What are you doing here? His opponent looked at him quizzically. Then he spoke again: Why did you come here? Why do you not leave me alone? I would have loved to talk to you about my feelings for you. But I can only tell you one thing. . s opponent offered softly. I dont think so.
 
Death took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. He closed his eyes for a moment before opening them again. His opponent was sitting across from him, hands folded together in front of him. They were looking at each other as if they had known each other their whole lives. Death opened his eyes to see that the numbers stopped blinking and he was staring into the face of his opponent. There was no mistaking who this person was. The man stood up and walked over to Death, placing his hands on either side of his head. It was like seeing something peculiar through someone else's eyes. After a few seconds, Death said, What are you doing here?You know what I mean. . s opponent offered softly. No, you dont have to say that. I am not going to lie to you. You are quite lovely.
 
Death scanned the room for any sign of his lover. He found nothing but a small table with two chairs in front of it. The numbers stopped blinking and Death sat down across from his opponent. They looked at each other as if they were seeing something peculiar about one another. It was then that Death said, It is my pleasure to introduce you to our new guest. We hope you will enjoy your stay here. Please excuse us while we make arrangements for your departure. Thank you very much for your time today. Goodbye! His opponent stood up and walked out of the room. . ",,fake
48," ID?  the clerk asks the kid at the counter.  Oh, yeah, I left it at home.     I can not sell you without ID  the clerk says, reaching out to put the cigarettes back on the shelf.  I get into trouble. I have to pay big money, my friend.    The teenager is playing on his phone. He looks completely disinterested. There was a time I could  ve lifted a phone right out of a stranger  s pocket and been halfway down the block before they noticed, but kids these days, eh? Always on the phone. Twenty-four/seven connection. Verizon Wireless is the new Doctor Feelgood. Still, I need a damn phone. The kid scoffs and walks away from the counter.     Phone.    The clerk forks over the burner phone. I slide a credit card through the machine.  You need minutes?  he asks, grabbing for a prepaid card.  Naw, just the phone. Thanks.    Purchasing minutes is a waste of resources. I open the phone and input a sequence of numbers. Now the phone had two hundred minutes. Plus unlimited texting and data. It  s what I do. I  m a technomancer. Any piece of technology, no matter how ancient, it  s my bitch. Proximity is the key though. I can make a TV snowy from states away, but standing next to a power station, I could shut down Hoover Dam. . She has posted over 200 photos today. Everyone today is plugged in. There  s no need to enforce Big Brother, we  ve willingly sacrificed ourselves to him. Sold off round-the-clock surveillance of our souls so that a thousand people can see the cranberry-pecan salad we ordered off the secret menu. The picture shows a twenty-something girl in oversized sunglasses behind the wheel of some cutesy mini-SUV. Of course she  s sticking her tongue out. It  s always that or some kind of half-kiss duck face. Nothing all that insidious on the surface, unless you count the fact that she  s Instagramming while driving. The text says,   Rooftop party tonite!!!!! Followed by about a thousand small, unintelligible icons. . This option shouldn  t even be on a burner phone. I don  t need any fancy magic to find her number. It  s mentioned directly on her FaceBook profile. I thumb the digits into the prompt and it starts tracking her. She  s at the cross-section of West Washington Heights and Almeda. It  s only ten blocks away. The silver Honda Accord sitting next to the curb unlock with a hand wave. The ignition starts with another gesture as I climb behind the wheel. Silver and midsize is good and inconspicuous. I put the car in drive and start over to the Fifth Autumn hotel. I dial Bail on the way.  Sup  Bail answers.  You sure about this?     Yeah. .     Three stations give confirmation  the Oracle says.  Right now its O  Reilly Factor, the Padres game, and The Simpsons.     It  s always the Simpsons, Bail.     Hey man, twenty-eight seasons taps a lot of precog info.     Hmmm, they really have done everything.     Yup.     So give me the confirmation.     Danielle Lewis. Twenty-three years old. She  s got over two thousand followers since she opened her account last week.  I could hear her whistle over the phone, obviously impressed.  Oh yeah, and she  s definitely Wendigo. Full transformation tonight. .     Downtown Fifth Autumn.     I knew that.      No you guessed that. I KNEW it.    I chuckle at her.  So Bail, have you got confirmation on our date?     Sorry bud, I have it on good authority there  s a Sanford and Son marathon on that night.     I  ll bring the pizza.     Oh, I  m washing my hair that night too.     I shoulda never gotten you that waterproof TV.     And I  m forever grateful. Mwah! Bye  she teases. . This is pretty far from the truth. Sure, it always ends in cannibalism, but it begins as an insatiable hunger. Hunger for food, money, power, or in this case, attention. It  s a lot easier to hide in this modern era of instant access and thumbs up gratification. I pull up to the valet station at Fifth Autumn and hand the kid a fiver . ",,real
49,"Who doesnt know Stella? Everyone knows about Stella and just as they know her, they also both love and envy her. Just like the rest of the crowd, I was likewise part of those who envied and loved her at the same time. I loved her life. To me, she had everything I wanted: good grades, scholarships, a pretty face, many friends, a perfect boyfriend and whatnot. To the quiet kid whos ever stuck in the library or some godforsaken corner. She was the complete opposite. There she is again, I said. Almost unheard. Wherever I was, she was there in her spotlight. She remained ever glowing, smiling with glee and constantly optimistic. Every day, I observed her. It was then I knew I hated her. I wanted to be Stella. I craved her spotlight; even craved everything she had. Even if I tried to be like her, I would just end up like the rest of the copycats, humiliated by her admirers. I knew better than anyone that I would not pull it off. I could only glimpse at her from the sidelines. It must be nice.., Youre surrounded by people as usual.

It was going to be like that until then. The library at our school is massive just as it was quiet. I always like to hang there after lectures since I hardly have any friends. I didnt like to read nor did I like to look at books but the ambience of the library was a stress relief. It was just like any other day. . This place was a labyrinth. The corner was lit by the Victorian styled window providing a sufficient amount of light. It was just your regular ancient, modern Victorian era library. For a high school it was really extravagant. There I was, going through Stellas photos online, when a pop-up notification appeared. Your soul switch is now available.

It perplexed me as I stared at the notification. I barely remember ever downloading the app where the notification came from. I quit the Gramm, which I spent most of my time criticising Stellas photo and went to my library of applications. It was there; the app called soul Switch. I straighten my shoulders a bit to sit upright. Im truly concerned now because I have a bizarre application that I do not remember downloading. . As you would expect, I clicked on it. Giving you a second chance to live the life you want, to be like the person youve wanted to be.

The utterly impossible line made me crack up. It was clickbait. I still couldnt resist finding out more about it. Envy fills the heart of a man till the point that its clustered and sprouts into desperation. I was desperate. If theres a slight chance of a second life, I want to be Stella. I swiped left on my screen to the primary interface of the app. It had a basic design, a plain white background and a big blue circular button with the words start soul switch aligned in the centre. I tapped the button and a terms and conditions page appeared. . I scoffed at the terms and couldnt remember one word after giving consent. Nothing happened after agreeing to the terms and conditions and waiting for the switch to load completely. My phone screen was completely blank. I half-expected it anyway, but it was disappointing. I laid on the wooden floor. My eyes became heavy, struggling to keep focus. I couldn't fight the urge and finally gave in to sleep. That was the last time I saw everything I knew. *****************

Shes beautiful!
I looked at the mirror with my hands on her - my face. She isnt as pretty as I was, but there was definitely a charm to her looks. A darker shade of my skin tone, almost the same body type with more curves. . The girl whose body I had taken was Ira Joy. I stopped going to school and holed up at home. A week had gone by since I became Ira. I wonder how the original soul of this body was doing. A good thing I left a diary to navigate her way around if she took my body. It was the only thing I could do for her, taking up my messed up life. How to get to her home was the tough part; it was a good thing she didnt have a lock on her phone. I cant imagine going around asking for my home address. Lets go Ira, her mom called out. They were leaving the country, her parents. She didnt want to go with them. When I became her, they were happy that she had finally agreed. . She had parents that loved her unconditionally and whatever decision she made; they were fine with it. The love she thought was a burden was what I longed for. I promise that well be fine, her dad said. He reached forward to give a kiss on my forehead. I know, dad, I said. I smiled at him, going forward to hug him. Her mom came in after unloading her bags into the cab. She walked towards us and wrapped her hands around us. Im also happy youre fine with it. Lets go now

Im happy that these are my parents. Mr. and Mrs. Joy were now my mom and dad. I envy you a lot Ira Joy. . To be myself was hard, surrounded by people that didnt like me. Everyone was always expecting something from me. They kept forcing their ideal type of person on me. I didnt have a place to be in my head, and everyone constantly drained me. I love this life. A life to myself, loving the things I want and doing the things I like. I dont feel pressured and Im allowed to have my heads up in the clouds. It was fate that I came across that unknown code to make that app. I wouldnt have worked if you didnt have such a strong will to be me. For the switch to happen, someone needed to wish to be me wholeheartedly, and once it happens, you cant undo it. Thank you for being the messed up and suffocated Stella. Im sorry that the perfect Stella is not the star, you know. . ",,real
