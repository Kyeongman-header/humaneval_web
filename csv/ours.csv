Windows let in deadly radiation, he had never even seen space with his own two eyes. Nearly a year traveling the fastest the ship could allow, and he had not made even a dent in his journey. They were traveling to the nearest planet, some 10 light years away. Even moving at a pace the laws of physics deemed illegal, they would be in a metal box, breathing artificial air and drinking in artificial light for years to come. They had not told him this when he became an astronaut. The emptiness of it all. He had dreams of milky heavens and radiant light, but there naught but nothing. Everything was racing away from him. It was a bitter irony, one he mused upon often. He looked at the monitor. They were passing by a black hole, an object of such mass, it's gravity pulled even light into it's abyss. He stared at the object. It was everything he had come to know about space. He pressed some keys on the controls, and the ship began to steer towards it. Everything in the universe ends up here, maybe I 'll find what I've been looking for.

It was then that the intergalactic battleships began to appear on the horizon. IOblivious to their surroundings as they continued to make their way through the darkness. As they made their way further into the darkness, they were able to see more than one thing : two mighty rings with red light scanning both sides of them. They stopped at each ring and looked up for a moment before continuing on their way. When they arrived at the second ring, they saw what appeared to be a large ship-like structure ; it seemed to be moving in different directions around itself.  What are you doing here?  asked the woman who had been standing next to him. She gave him a look that told him she didn  t want to answer his question.

His black cloak billowed around him as he paced, the rich, dark fabric making his pale skin look as though it were glowing. His presence in the room was enough to set a chill in the air ; each time he passed in front of me, I felt my skin prickle. Meanwhile, I sat bound to a chair by rope so thick that I thought it might be strong enough to support the weight of a small country. A hanging, flickering light swung above us, which, despite the dire circumstances, I could not help but find about as annoying as a housefly. `` You know why you are here, yes? '' the Baron asked. I hesitated, then nodded. I have been searching for years, but I finally caught one of you, '' he glanced at me. `` You will lead me to victory. '' He stopped his pacing and smiled a smile completely devoid of warmth. I remained silent. His smile quickly disappeared and an annoyed look took over his face. `` Well? What was your last invention, Tinkerer? '' `` I... er, I made a machine that produces beams of electromagnetic radiation to cook things, '' I responded slowly. The Baron's eyes lit up. `` Like someone's head? '' My mouth twisted. Confused, I said, `` No, like a burrito. '' `` A burrito... You are talking of food?! What use is that to me? '' I shrugged. 
`` What was your creation before that? '' `` It was a machine that slowly warmed and burned using electricity ''   `` Ahh, yes! Like a more modern version of a brazen bull, '' he interrupted. `` Now that is ideal! How many people can fit inside it? '' he asked, his smile returning. Once again, I was left perplexed. `` No, it was used on things like bread. You may have heard of it ; it's called a toaster? '' `` A *toaster*? Of course I've heard of a toaster! Who hasn't heard of that? You didn't invent that! '' `` Oh no, no, of course not. I just built a more efficient one, '' I explained nervously. The Baron was staring at me again. 
`` Okay, I have to ask : you *are* a Tinkerer, yes? '' `` Yes, '' I said, my voice breaking as I did. `` Okay, what was your last *original* invention? '' I thought about it. `` Well... a few months ago, I made a machine with blades so sharp they could cut through any sort of ''   `` Bone? Flesh? Bank vault doors?

After a moment, he said quietly, `` Are you talking about a blender? '' `` Oh god, no! I'm talking about a smoothie machine. '' 
Finally, he opened his eyes and said, `` Are you capable of making anything other than kitchen appliances? '' `` I think so, Mr. von Baron, '' I said, feeling uncertain. `` Please, call me Baron, '' he said distractedly. `` So, if I told you I need you to invent something that can be harnessed to serve the greater evil, something that perhaps involves heat... maybe even oil... '' he trailed off, his eyes glazing over with a dreamy look. I leaned forward as much as my binding would allow, excited at the prospect of pleasing my captor. `` I think I made something like that once. It's a big pot of hot oil that you drop things into to ''   `` That's a deep fryer. '' I paused. 
Baron von Baron sighed. `` Well... while you're here, you can at least fix up my kitchen. '' -- -- -   \ # 7. I'm still very new to writing, so criticisms would be extremely appreciated! : )

5,"XR-378 trundled along, its treads crushing dried clods of dirt into powder as it rumbled along the rough, badly maintained track. Once, this track had been paved with smooth asphalt, a road flat enough for XR-378's wheeled brethren to glide along. Now, however, that asphalt had long since cracked and been crushed down by the bots with treads, and those with wheels could no longer traverse this way. XR-378 moved along without concern, however, one large claw held up to protect the item it had gathered. Its protocols gave clear instructions on what to do next, and it couldn't think of anything but obeying. Of course, XR-378 didn't really think at all, not really. That's not how robots work. They're given a set of protocols to carry out, and they do so. XR-378 hadn't seen an external force in a long time. If it could think, it might have glanced at its CPU clock and wondered what was taking the next set of orders so long to arrive. However, as mentioned before, robots don't operate this way. They obey their protocols, and right now, XR-378's protocols told it to proceed back to the base location, bearing the object it had identified and plucked from the brown and nondescript landscape. It reached the base, the ground beneath its treads shifting from crumbling, dry dirt over to metal with regular striations, treads to increase friction. XR-378 headed up a ramp, past several airlocks. Barcode scanners mounted next to the airlocks scanned the panels on XR-378, and mounted cannons momentarily ceased their hum as they lowered at his passage. 
The arm extended, gripping its find. For several minutes, the chamber filled with the humming of various high-energy devices as the composition of the object was analyzed all the way down to the subatomic level. Finally, a light on a panel above XR-378 lit up, and a bell rang out. XR-378 sat motionless, awaiting orders. Dust fell from a speaker as it crackled into dusty life. `` Organic material identified, '' a smooth, flat female voice called out. `` Querying remote master controller for instructions. '' XR-378 sat and waited. `` Unable to make contact with remote master controller, '' the female voice said after a minute. `` Warning : connection has not been established for one thousand, eight hundred, and seventy four cycles. This exceeds recommended parameters. Override? '' Another pause. 
Local unit will attempt to establish a connection at next cycle. Querying local database for orders. '' This time, after a minute, another light clicked on. `` Local orders determined. '' The flat female voice faded, and was replaced by a choked, half-strangled voice, filled with rage and pain. `` Kill them! Kill all the bastards, kill them all, they dared to attack, this will teach them to mess with- ''   The insane, raging voice cut off mid-sentence. `` Local orders recommend destruction, '' the female voice intoned. `` Deposit specimen in appropriate receptacle. '' XR-378 trundled forward as a hatch slid open. The small little green shoot in its claw moved slightly in the breeze before XR-378 dropped it into the chute. 
`` Return to patrol, '' the female voice commanded, and XR-378 turned and headed back out of the chamber. Its treads once again crunched on the dirt as it resumed its patrol, moving across the dry and arid land. Its red sensors scanned, searching for the next eventual appearance of organic material.

It's been hard finding money for my new home, but I'm finally making enough money to get by. As a child, I used to play hide and seek in the woods behind my house with my older brother, Billy. He would often make fun of me because I never did anything like he did. One day, while playing hide-and-seek, we got into a fight. We both ended up on the ground. That's when our adoptive family started to take care of us. MyThinking about it made me realize how lucky I am to have such a great family. They always sticks together through thick and thin, even if they dont know each other very well. When I was younger, I wanted to be just like them.

It's been 3 years since my adoptive family started their new year family tradition. My dad is finally making enough money to pay for college. He has never done anything like this in his entire life. It's hard finding money when you're an only child. So he decided to give me the book containing 1,000 wishes. His first wish was to help me get full ability to fly. That dream could come true. After reading the book, he asked me if I would kindly consider coming back home with him on New Year's Eve. I told him no because I want to spend the night with my parents. Since then, we have been spending most of our time together
My mother and Billy often make fun of me for not being able to read or write but they always say that it will happen one day. They don't understand why I cant do those things so easily.

She had just finished 6 hour of work as a substitute teacher and she wants to be a teacher herself. But her father didn

It's hard finding money when you're living on your own. However, I am finally making enough money to buy myself a new car. As soon as I get full ability to drive, I will start buying cars again. After all, what other dream could come true? The next day, I received a letter from my adoptive family.

It always sticks together no matter where we go or who we meet. My parents are very proud of me but Billy often make fun of me because I am different from them. He says that I stick like sticky tape in his heart. They told me that if I can get full ability then all my dreams will come true. That's why they gave me a book containing 1,000 pages of instructions on how to become a superhero. The only problem with being a superhero is that you need to be able to control your powers which makes it hard finding money to

If you would kindly consider coming back home we can continue our New Year family tradition. 
That's the thing about being adopted, everyone always sticks together and helps each other out no matter what. We don't stick like sticky tape but rather as a glue that holds us together.

I hurried my pace to the bus stop realizing I may just be scaring myself. Then I heard foot steps and looked back and saw two men speaking to each other while walking behind me. I saw the bus stop a few blocks ahead and thought the broken street lights seemed to be on their side. I thought I had made it, I thought they were farther back. I felt someone grab my shoulder with such force that let me instantly know they weren't going to tell me I had dropped something. I turned quickly my breath already becoming rushed, hands shaky with the sudden instant surge of adrenaline. `` Give me your fuckin wallet '' The smaller man said in a hurry. I was frozen in fear and the big man without warning punched me straight in the stomach, I bent over and he pushed me down on the sidewalk. I felt hands going in my pockets and grabbing my phone and wallet. More kicks, more pain and the fear of it getting worse. I heard one of them say `` Your name is Kristoff, Ha, what a stupid name ''    They had what they wanted but still they kept beating, then an unfortunate kick to my head that sent the world ringing and my thoughts escaped me. I felt as if someone else was there for a second, as if someone else was standing over me. And then the yell, a type of scream I've never heard before. Pain mixed with horror and splash of surprise. I opened my black and bruised eyes and was not prepared for what I saw. 
And all I could think of was how can it be that bright if its so dark. I stood up confused and still fearful. The small man had pulled his gun and was pointing it at me. But I had not done this, I was on the floor weak and defenseless... why fear me. `` Don't move you asshole look what you did to Tim '' the small man said. `` I, I, I '' I couldn't even speak as I raised my trembling hands. Whatever the small man saw he saw it coming for him and shot at me. BANG! the gun shot rang but strangely it seemed muffled compared to the beating I had just withstood. I saw something around me, a blur of a kind, a form that you can never really be sure you've seen. 
And in the darkness i realized the morbid reality. His had been picked right off. Next to him it lay with the look of surprise still upon it. I did the only thing I could do, I ran. I ran past the bus stop as thoughts ran through my head. Thoughts of my child hood and bullies being pulled out of school for being strangely bruised. My step father dieing so suddenly in his sleep. All of them harming me, all of them using me to relieve their pains in life. What am I that could have done that? What am I assuming could have happened? What am I?

She could here their voices among the pounding fists and splintering wood. Shouts, guttural noises, snarls. These aren't people, she thought to herself. Human beings wouldn't do what they did. She had a plan. She wouldn't  let them get their way. The door ahead of her bowed with each blow from the outside. She splashed the remaining gasoline along the floor in front of her, in front of the doorway. Then she sat and waited, trying to ignore the sounds, and what was to come. She thought of the world before-of her family, her friends, the simple things she 'd never get back. The door cracked, a large hole gaping from the middle, filled with hands clawing at the remaining wood. Not long now, she thought, as she drew the lighter from her pocket. It was a zippo, adorned with a 4 leaf clover. `` For luck '', her father had told her. 
The door gave an awful groan, it's last protest against the mob's weight, and broke free of it's hinges, hitting the floor. She looked at them with a mixture of fear blending into amusement, as she lit the Zippo. She breathed a sigh of relief, and let the light fall, igniting the fuel around her. That was it. She was safe in the fire. They can't hurt her anymore. Nothing can.

The trip to the moon, the satellites to all the planets, those were amazing, full of potential. When they captured a asteroid and brought it back to their own planet, so quickly had they learned as evident by the mineral collection that followed. In light of those, his mission... well..   To be fair the galactic nation had been eagerly awaiting humans to break free of their solar system, though a violent species their pursuit of efficiency was admired and it would have been nice to have some fresh blood. That he, Admiral Elohim, a fan of humans, had been sent now seemed to have been a harsh reaction to a seemingly innocent mistake. `` How could they have known? ``, he thought out loud, thinking of that damn gold disk. The poor humans had no idea that it contravened Galactic Obscenity Law 1001.2 Subsection 4. Even that could have been forgiven, but it floated by a group of school children... the Galactic council was appalled. `` Wait until they conquer there pursuit of lust... then they can join us! '' cried the council. Elohim sighed.. '' Kingdom, activate Earth Envelope, set it to encompass the Mars orbit... we will leave them that at least ''   As he said it, a dark matter seeped out of the ship and slowly enveloped the Orbit of Mars, allowing Earth to access it's sun, Mercury, Venus and Mars, but no further, humanity would be cut off from the rest of the universe until it had matured a bit.

We had been looking forward to it for months. But now that we are here, everything is different. The ceremony is over but the thoughts still swirl around in my head. ""Wren,"" I whisper into her ear. She doesn't respond. Instead, she looks at me expectantly. ""What do you want?"" I ask again. ""I don't know."" Her eyes dart from side to side before settling on mine. ""a siren blares through the air. A sickening feeling starts to settle in your stomach. You take a deep breath and try not to think about what will happen next. As soon as you step out of the car, there's no turning back. No matter how hard you try, nothing works. Your feet feel like they're going to give out right then and there. There's only one thing left to do. If you can make it this far, maybe you can get some rest. And if you can't, well
IOddly enough, she doesnt seem to notice that Im still staring at her. Wren?
 
What are you doing here? Why did you come all the way from New York City?"" Wren looks offended by my sudden outburst. She sits down across from me on the bench near the window. Her gaze stays plastered on me for a long time before she finally says, I wanted to talk to you. The previous conversation disappears into thin air. My heart is beating faster than it has ever been since I saw her twenty four years earlier. How could she have known?
TheStumbling over his own feet as he tries to keep up with the following line hundreds of yards in front of them. He can't help but feel his palms growing sweaty even though he's not supposed to be sweating. A sickening feeling starts to take hold of him and he feels like he might pass out. His vision begins to blur and he struggles to stay upright. As soon as he realizes what's going on, he turns around and sees Wren standing next to him. ""Are you okay?"" she asks. ""Yes,""

Wren reaches across the table and places a hand on her husband's shoulder. ""I'm so sorry."" The previous conversation disappears into thin air. ""You know I don't want to go through this again. It hurts too much for me right now. """"It doesn't have to hurt more than it already does. You just need to accept that things are going to get easier from here on out. That is all there is to it.

In fact, if you were ever able to see him again, you would not recognize him. If you tried to talk to him, he would only tell you

He shuddered, before looking back at his brother, putting his hands on his hips, and Aylin wondered if he was in a position where he would be able to quickly pull out the many knives he just knew was on Ryusei's person at all times. ""I've humored you long enough, but it's been nearly an hour, it's getting dark, and you still haven't told me why we're headed out into the middle of nowhere with only your boyfriend helping us.""""Boyfriend?!"" Lucca asked, taking a step back and then awkwardly laughing, rubbing the back of his neck, while Aylin just ignored Ryusei's comment with an eye roll. ""I don't want you getting all excited before we get there."" The thought about wandering around in the woods at night caused an uncomfortable churning in his stomach, remembering those horrendous cases he had solved. ""I hope you'll be ready for what might happen. ""Ryusei's entire face lit up as he started getting excited, ""Are you giving me free rein to play?""""No."" Aylin replied instantly, ""Killing is a last resort, but you are also the most competent in a fight out of the three of us, so you can... knock people out, I guess."" ""So if I can't kill,"" Ryusei shrugged, ""At least, I can beat the ever-loving crap outta something! Because come on, self-defense clearly means this kind of person shouldn't be around."" 
Is it too much to ask why he's like that? """"We both took our parents' deaths in our own way. I became a detective and Ryusei...""""Snapped? """"I don't even know anymore. Sometimes Ryu's a heinous killer, but other times he's the sanest of us all. And even when he's at his worst..."" he shook himself, not wanting to go into his feelings with someone, because that would mean needing to confront his past himself, which was something he didn't want to doespecially in the middle of the woods while working a case.They walked in silence for a moment, and Aylin heard the sounds ahead of Ryusei climbing a tree. What was his brother doing?Just as he thought that Ryusei swung down, ""Boo!"" 
""""Maybe not for you, but it sure was for me."" He winked, ""I'm kidding. But come on, I noticed a creepy cabin not far from here. So I can get in. Whatcha need in there? """"We actually need to know what is in there, and you're better at getting into places undetected. ""Ryusei gaped, ""Hearing compliments from you are so rare, Lune!"" He grinned, pulling a knife out of his pants and handing it to Aylin, ""Don't want you and Lucca to be sitting ducks while I'm in there. """"No way, I'm going in there too!"" Lucca said, ""I'm the one who lives in this town, so I would have a better idea of what anything we find in there is. 
What if there's someone in there, and this is actually unrelated to the case?"" Ryusei scoffed,""You think that just because I'm a serial killer means I'm out of control? I have an MO, you know, I actually make sure people are guilty before I kill them. """"Then explain why you keep formaldehyde on your person at all times."" ""Just in case it comes down to that. What if we get in there and someone's torturing a child or a puppyobviously, I'd need to act."" ""Not to condone murder,"" Lucca piped up, ""But I wouldn't be heartbroken if he killed someone like that."" Aylin glared, but then softened at the embarrassed look on Lucca's face,""We need to hand that kind of person over to the authorities. """"What authorities?!"" 
""Aylin had no response to that, and Ryusei nodded, not saying anything but acknowledging the truth. The walk to the cabin was brought with Ryusei attempting to make small talk with Lucca, who still had mixed feelings about talking to a known and famous serial killer as the son of the police chief.Thankfully, the place seemed to be open, and Ryusei pulled out a lockpicking tool, only to frown at the coded digital lock, which was unbefitting this tiny cabin. But then he got out some blush, blowing it onto the pad and seeing the fingerprints over the code. It took three attempts to put in the right combination of numbers, but it worked, and they were let in.Lucca went to take a step in, but Ryusei stopped him, ""Motion detector cameras. Alright, this is going to be interesting."" 
If this is that annoying Ring crap, there will still be an alert, but we will have a decent enough amount of time to investigate and then leave."" He groaned, ""But this is so pathetic. Normally I take time to analyze where I'm breaking into, so I can get in with style and grace, not running and using spraypaint like an amateur!"" Despite himself, Aylin giggled a little bit at Ryusei's wild arm moments of exasperation. Then he walked over to a desk, and there was a cabinet, and when he looked inside, he found a safe, ""Ryu, can you open this? """"I'm an assassin not-for-hire, not a burglar."" Ryusei replied with a nonchalant hand gesture, ""You're gonna need someone else for that. But anyway, I found diamonds!"" 
""How are there diamonds here? I haven't seen any mines around here. Is there some sort of scheme going on? Lucca"" he saw Lucca, who had fallen to his knees, and ran over, ""Lucca, what's wrong?"" But he saw what was resting in Lucca's hand and understood.Lucca was holding his father's cracked watch, which in itself would be innocent enough if they weren't in the cabin, which was without a doubt connected to a murder case. Tears spilled down Lucca's rosy cheeks, and Ryusei was able to read the room, choosing not to say anything as Aylin tried to comfort his friend, who slowly started sobbing. ""ItIt"" Lucca hiccuped, holding the watch to his chest, ""It can't be true! It can't be! 
We don't have enough evidence to explain anything. Our next step is to find out if this is part of the case, okay?"" Lucca nodded, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand and trying to calm himself down, ""Okay. I just... need a moment to process the fact my Dad could seriously be...""Aylin pulled out his phone, taking pictures of everything in the cabin, ""How about we head back and talk to Eyla about this? If anyone knows about diamonds nearby, it would probably be her. We'll all get some sleep, and regroup with Gavin and crew tomorrow. """"I don't want to go home."" Lucca muttered, ""Mother will kill me for being out so late."" ""Well, you can stay overnight with us!"" Ryusei chirped, ""You have that project, right? 
""""I don't want to be a bother,"" Lucca muttered, and Aylin helped him stand,""You're never a bother, and if Ryusei trusts you, it means you've got a protector. """"No killing my family,"" Lucca instantly said to Ryusei, who looked a little put-out, but did nod to show his compliance as he gestured for the two to leave the cabin and put on a mask so he could wipe the paint off the cameras.""Fine. Let's head home before it gets too eerily dark.""

15,"Ive always wanted to be a writer. My friends always told me that I was the best at it, but I dont know if they were right or not. After graduating high school, I decided to take up writing as a career. I started by starting a small audience blog and then moved on to several film festival script competitions. I had my first one nearly completed when I finally realized college was out of the question for me. I applied to colleges all over the country in hopes of finding a place where I could play basketball and work part-time while attending social interactions. Unfortunately, I never got accepted to any of them. The only reason I went to college was because I felt like I needed to do something with my life. TheoDo you ever wonder why you are here? Why did you decide to make this decision? Do you have any regrets? Did you want to spend your life doing what you love? Are you happy? Or are you sad? If you think about it, how can you be happy? How can you feel content? Is there anything else you wish you could do? There is so much more to live for than just being able to enjoy yourself.
Im not sure if I like the idea of a career as an actor but thats where I am right now. After graduating high school, I decided to go back to college and pursue my dream of becoming an actor. My friends always told me that acting isnt easy or even interesting, but I was determined to get into it. When I finally realized college was out of the question, I started applying to film schools around the country. I applied to several film festival script competitions with zero payoffs besides a few small audience blog-writing gigs. The first one nearly completed in less than a month. It was then that I got interested in writing full-length novels. I wrote two short stories which were submitted to various film festivals
ItTowards the end of my senior year, I joined a recreational basketball league. As part of my program, I had to be in excellent physical shape so that I could play basketball for the team. During this time, I learned how to cook by scrubbing overcooked meat from pots and pans. At the beginning of our season, we went to a five-star Italian restaurant on the outskirts of town. We ate there three times a week
IA few years later, I finally realized college wasnt what it was cracked up to be. After graduating high school, I decided to go into business. My friends always told me not to pursue any kind of career until I was financially stable enough to do so. They were right. I am now working as a chef at a 5-Star Italian restaurant. It has been quite an interesting journey. The first one nearly completed when I was only twenty-five. I spent about two weeks getting used to the cooking process. Scrubbing overcooked meat, making good money waiting for people to order their food, and attending social interactions with other diners. When I turned thirty-five, I moved out of my parents house and onto my own
AfteroThing is, I had zero payoffs besides the small audience blog that I wrote back in high school. So why did I keep writing? Because I wanted to know who I was going to be after graduation. And because I needed to know if I would ever see them again. Thats why I kept writing.

When I finally realized college was out of the question for me, I decided to pursue a career as a writer. My friends always told me how much they loved my writing and encouraged me to continue it. After graduating high school, I moved to New York City where I worked at a five-star Italian restaurant. It was an amazing job with good pay and lots of benefits. While working there, I became very interested in becoming a screenwriter. I started several film festival script competitions over the course of two years. The first one nearly completed when I received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. The second one was almost finished when I got a call from NECA asking me to join their board of directors. At this point, I was making good money waiting for grants to come through so I could start paying off my student loans. 
After graduation high school that year, I joined a recreational basketball league which had zero payoffs besides being able to go to the gym once or twice a week. Still, I wanted to get back into sports because I didnt know what else to do. One day, during lunch break, I found myself scrubbing overcooked meat
IA few years later, after graduating high school, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a film director. My friends always told me how talented I was, but I did not want to believe them. I applied to several film festival script competitions and came up short each time. I finally realized college wasn't going to be enough for me if I couldn't find a solid friend group. So, I took a job as an intern at a 5-star Italian restaurant in New York City. It was fun working there while attending social interactions with people from all over the world. The only downside is that I spent most of my time cleaning tables and scrubbing oven mitts. However, I enjoyed it so much that I started doing it more often. 
After graduating High School, I went back to work until I could afford to move out on my own. After graduation, I joined a recreational basketball league where I played alongside some of my best friends. We had a lot of fun together. Our rec league placed second in our state last year. At this point, we were financially stable enough to have a good amount of free time when we werent playing basketball. This allowed us to travel

19,".Yeou.Haneul couldnt imagine what went through the minds of Yeous parents to name her something so vile. So accusing. Fox. As flattering as it is to have a human named after ones own kind, Haneul could only imagine the poor girl growing up with eggs thrown at her head and people pushing her off swing sets. Whatever weird things bullies did in the 21st century. Maybe foxes had finally lost their bad rep around town. People can change after centuries of labeling gumihos as seductive villains for wanting to fit in with their two-legged, two-handed friends. Enemies. It genuinely depends on who you ask. Kill her. Just kidding. Haneul has decided murdering isn't the best way to live a long, gumiho life. He's changed since the 1400s. Seriously. He swears on all nine of his tails. In the middle of the night, Haneul left the rural land where the so-called solitary gumihos roamed. He traveled to the small house that little Yeou abides in. Her parents were sleeping in what the humans call a master bedroom, for the significant people of the family. They were usually the tallest ones that grew shriveled skin as time went on.Haneul pranced into the childs room (a nursery, they call it), which was easily identifiable with a sign taped to the wall. 
. Gongju. Princess. As if a princess would live in this small town, unguarded by soldiers with sharp blades and petrifying glares. Perhaps the parents knew that Haneul was out for their daughter. This could be a trap to intimidate him. Oh well. Only one way to find out. Sauntering through the door like a bored angel strolling through heaven, Haneul found Yeou laying with a lavender-hued blanket wrapped around her. The babys lips pursed in a ""heart shape,"" as people call it (which isn't actually the shape of a human heart). Yeous whole stomach rose with each breath like a little beast was sleeping instead of an infant. 
If Haneul was human, he would roll his eyes at the display of mightiness. However, Haneul was not human, so he simply wrapped one thick tail around her light form, another tail against the childs mouth in case she began to screech in that horrible way babies do. Then, he trudged out of the house, just the way he came. Haneul took her far, far away from any gumihos-or humans-sight. Fox spirits didnt like him anyway, for his merciful, relatively kind manners towards humans. So he left without turning back once.Ysee? Haneul may be a gumiho but he is a sweet creature, too. You just need to give him a chance. 
She had that glow that many couldnt even attain after smothering mud and thin masks on their faces. Haneul could only imagine her in the fifteenth century, luring innocent ladies and gentlemen into their deaths for 1,000 years. Obviously, he was not very supportive of that abusive behavior anymore, so Haneul didnt force her to run into forests and make wanderers fall in love with her. Its not like anyone even went through these forests anymore. Thats why Yeou and Haneul were so safe from any nasty humans.The pair didnt have to worry about gumihos, either. Haneul hadnt seen another enchanted fox since Yeou turned three in human years. It was odd, but perhaps the fox spirits had all finished their killings and become human. 
Either way, the fewer gumihos and humans roaming near them, the safer Haneuls poor girl is. Well, Yeou couldnt even be called poor girl anymore, despite her unfortunate name. She was strong, swift, and smart, spending most of her time racing through the forest and bringing back trinkets from her journeys. Her favorite was a gold earring that she punctured through her right ear. Haneul slept through most days and hunted for food at dusk. Dont worry, he only killed rabbits and the occasional chipmunk. He even kept Yeous diet to mostly berries and plants. Apparently, humans can get protein poisoning from eating too many rabbits. 
Haneul was patiently waiting for Yeou to come back to their den with a golden earring, metallic locket, or any other random token of adventure. However, when Yeou was back, she did not carry a smooth crystal or bewitching ring. She was dragging something else into the den. A dead human.With brown, lustrous hair matted with blood at her shoulders and sharp features that would make a siren cry in jealousy. Red fingerprints were scattered over her neck. Yeou had strangled her to death.Communication with Yeou has never been a problem. Haneul peered up at her, pulling off his best inquiring look while maintaining unwavering eye contact. He cant show fear or hatred towards the human child. 
Bending down, Yeou opened the dead beings eyes. Solid gold. Just like Haneuls. Another gumiho. The first one Haneul had seen since Yeou was of walking age laid dead at his paws. That was probably a good thing, though, considering that this fox was likely attempting to kill Yeou. Waving the girl away, the gumiho grasped the dead spirit by its neck and dragged it into the night. Haneul peered around for a moment, ensuring that no other gumiho knows about Yeou before venturing into the forest, and finding a place to bury the dead body.Or he could just leave it in the water.Haneul was dragging the body towards the river when the human-gumiho, leg twitched. Then her arm. 
Murderer. she muttered in a silky voice. Figures. Gumihos dont die easily. Dropping the spirit to the grass, Haneul trills in questioning. Go to our land. Youll see.Though he takes a bite of the bewildering gumihos neck, he still obeys, wanting to see the remainder of his kind.It took half an hour for Haneul to reach the abandoned suburbs of the town, but he took in every step like he was savoring a bite of a delectable snack. Nostalgia was common amongst gumihos.But the moment Haneul stepped into the plains where the gumihos slept, any wave of bittersweet ecstasy left him and he understood the words of the now-dead spirit that Yeou dragged in. 
Across the land, enchanted spirits lay dead on the ground, in both human and fox form. Shredded, limb for limb in cold blood. It was a bloodbath. Who could do such a deed?And naturally, upon further inspection, Haneul found his answer. Every gumiho in human form was missing something. But what caught Haneuls eye was a gumiho with one gold earring hanging on her left ear. And he knew exactly where the other one was. Before he could react, someone was on top of him, elbow against his throat. Haneul didnt need to look to know who it was. Murderer.

Well, I imagine they say that. I always thought their twenty-four-hour clock sounded so much more glamorous yet practical. It never repeats until a new day begins. When I opened my place, I listed my reservation options on the website using the 24-hour clock, but the elegance of that format confused a lot of people. Well, I think it did. I lost my restaurant trying to make taste buds tingle to railway time. My mother said I never had any business opening a restaurant, not even a lemonade stand. She claims I can't organize anything and that I hate the routine needed to survive in any business. She also said that I could fuck up a cracker for a starving man. Rethinking the whole thing, the 24-hour clock does make the American five oclock seem like a long way off. For drinkers, a drink should always seem like its one minute away. Damn. Its hard to tell time when youre drunk. 
That always infuriated me, so I ended the discussion by beginning it with a question like, Which upscale Appalachian dish do you meangoat balls? Still, I know I messed up some of the dishes on the menu even though I love Europe. Europes a big place. Its hard to create a decent menu based on a continent of forty-four countries. Hell, I cant even name all of the countries and honestly, Ive never been outside of the United States. Its starting to feel like Ive never been outside of this taco truck. Its a country of its own. No, it's a continent full of American taco shells that collide like continental shelves when the owner farts. This thought made me laugh so hard that he asked if Id been drinking again. 
***If it wasnt for the taco truck job, I wouldnt have enough money to even consider suicide in a respectable manner, which to me means a suicide performed peacefully in a bathtub full of bubble bath while drinking the finest whatever I can get my hands on. Bubble bath and the finest whatever cost money. Ive told my mother this a million times. The last time I mentioned it, she said her arthritis was the only thing that kept her from killing me. Ah, shit, here we go again, Mom said. You begged me to take you in after that dumb fucking bisto""Bistro, Mom, bistro, for fucks sake.Oh, whatever the hell you call it you shouldnt have opened it and now you gotta live with Mama. 
You better not kill yourself here. You get your own home if you want to do that because this is my home, not yours. Theres no peaceful anything for you here, not even a peaceful suicide. Ill kill you before I let you do that to my bathtub, she said, slamming her bedroom door. I could hear her opening her underwear drawer for the Southern Comfort.About an hour later, I found her cuddling the bottle like most women cuddle a man. Well, thats how I feel about being a woman. At forty-nine. I cuddle bottles instead of men. I leaned over to hear if she was still breathing and also because I saw whisky in the bottle. 
This aint your party time. Then she fell back asleep with a snore.She didnt break my nose, but it hurt. ***Tonight, Steve suggested that I go to AA. I resisted the urge to say that I wish hed suppress his ideas but let his farts fly free all the time because they sound better than any of his ideas. But the work line I walk is thin, and the home I make a living hell is no sure thing, especially without a bit of cash. There are many reasons to work a job but liking it usually isn't one of them.Customers complain about you a lot. They say you make the tacos soggy. I think its because you drink too much.Yeah, I do. 
My God, I was standing there saying the same thing Ive said for the last twenty years. I wanted a drink so bad.It felt like he was reading my mind because he said, Youre here because I love your mom, and she said that if were gonna get married, I need to give you a job. It might sound funny, people our age wanting to get married. But I don't want to be alone no more. I love your mom so much that she can drink all she wants. But you cant do that because you work for me, and Ill be damned if you ruin my place like you ruined your own. I mean to support your mother in the finest ways. I want to take her to Florida in the winter. And you really do need AA. 
He wasnt the first of her men to give me a job. It hurts my heart, the things that old man doesn't know.Now, are you going to go to AA or what? Its the start of a new life. For all of us. I may be the oldest, whitest son of a bitch youve ever seen, but I know Mexican food, by God. My wife always made the best tacos. And look, I know you like to cook so you can use some authentic Mexican food things that you like. If you just tell me what it is, I'll get it. Come on, Angie, he said, opening his arms wide. Put that big pretty head of yours right here on my shoulder and let me hug you so hard you bust your gut. 
This is where we can make dreams. ""I squinted my eyes against the tears. Loners shun the family they have, and I hated to accept a hug from my boss who dreamed nonsense about my mother. But he was right. I had a big head. I hugged him back. ""Will you go, for me? he asked, squeezing hard. ""We really could make this work. """"Sure, I will, Steve,"" I said, not sure if I was lying or not. But I was going to a party after closing. ***I stood outside Debbies house looking at a guy I wanted to light my cigarette. Just ask,I hoped. Just ask. Let me know I have something to offer. 
Finally, I said, Do you have a light?He lit me up then went back to scrolling, but my sun didnt want to set. The great anti-smoking campaign worked, didnt it?Nothing. Well, it did in some ways. I mean, were the only two out here. No ones smoking cigarettes inside, you know. Theyre all doing whatever and drinking, but none of them are smoking.He kept scrolling, but said,I did whatever earlier. Now Im smoking a cigarette. A good cig is hard to beat, he said, walking toward the door. Im going to smoke inside from now on.I laughed. Really?

21,"Im sitting in the elevator with Ryan. Its been a really shitty day and I dont want to talk about it anymore. So, Liv? Ryan asks after nearly 30 seconds of silence. He looks at me as if he is trying to figure out what to say next. His eyes are red and his mouth is hanging open. My throat feels like it's going to burst from my vocal chords. What am I supposed to tell him? Yeah, Ive had a bad day. I think I need to go home.
 
He gives me a look that makes me feel like I should be ashamed of myself for not being able to speak up sooner. But then again, how could I have done anything differently? We were just having a romantic meal together. It was such a nice surprise when she walked into the restaurant without looking back at me. She looked so happy! Her hair was blowing in the wind and her face was glowing with happiness. As soon as she saw me, she grabbed my hand and led me inside. Without even looking at us, she said, What do you want

 
I dont know what to say anymore. I can feel sharp pains shooting through my body. My throat feels like its going to burst. The only thing that keeps me from throwing up is the fact that Ryan has been talking to me for nearly 30 seconds now. He tells me that he loves me and wants to spend more time with me. It makes me cry even though I have no reason to believe him. Why would he lie to me? Just because I love him does not mean we should be together all of the time. We could go out for a romantic meal right now just to get away from each other. But then again, why am I subjecting anyone else to this kind of abuse? Is it really worth it? 
He looks at me as if he thinks I'm crazy or something. You look super pale. What are you doing here Liv? Ryan asks in a low voice. His eyes widen when he sees me crying. For some reason, I still feel shocked by his question. After staring at him for so long, I decide to speak up. ""It's okay. I've had a really shitty day.""
I dont say another word until we reach the restaurant. The driver makes eye contact with me and gives me a dirty look before pulling out of the parking lot without looking back. We walk into the restaurant and order our food. Its an Italian place that is very popular around here. They have all sorts of different dishes on their menu including lasagna, spaghetti, meatballs, salad, pasta, breadsticks, etc. Our waiter comes over and sits down next to us. He smiles at us and says, Can I get you anything to drink? You look like you need it.
 
I shake my head and tell him not to worry about it. My throat feels like it has been cut open and I can feel sharp pains
He grabs my hand and pulls me in for a hug. Are you okay? he asks as he places his hands on my shoulders. I start to cry even though I know this isn't what I want to do right now. This was supposed to be a romantic meal together. But instead, I'm just crying because Ryan broke up with me. His face looks so sad when he tells me that. 
I*
 
The elevator stops at the top of the building. The driver makes eye contact with me but doesnt say another word. He gets out of the car and starts walking down the stairs. After nearly 30 seconds of walking, he finally reaches the ground floor. He turns around and walks towards me without looking back. Without even looking at me, he says, You look super pale.
	I turn around and walk away from him. My throat feels like its going to explode. I feel sharp pains shooting through my entire body. I cant breathe. All I can think about is Olivia. How could she have done this to me? Why did she have to go through this alone? 
He looks at me for a few seconds before speaking up again. What are you talking about Liv? Ryan asks as he takes his seat next to me. His voice is low and shaky so I don't know if he's crying or just trying to be polite. We sit in silence for almost an hour while we wait for our food. It was such a romantic meal right after work that I wanted to cry even though

The driver makes eye contact with me, but does not say another word. Without looking back into my eyes, he drives out of the parking lot. He doesnt come back until nearly 30 seconds have passed. After all this time, I still feel shocked by what happened. My throat feels like its going to burst. I can barely breathe through my nose. The whole elevator ride has been torture. I hate being stuck in this elevator. I want to get out of here. I do not want to spend the rest of my life trapped in this place. I wish I could run away from this horrible situation. But I can't. No matter how many times I try to escape, I cannot. I will never leave

I look around to see if there are any signs of life on this far away land. There's no sign of anything. My thoughts seem distant as I walk through the plain brown soil. All I can think about is where I am going. It's been so long since I have walked out into the world. Where did I come from? How did I get here? ",,fake
23,"   The village headsman waited outside the door of Gristlethumb  s house. He was at least 40 years old, and he wore a wrinkled cloak that hung loosely over his shoulders. His hair was unkempt, as if it hadn  t been combed in days. A gold candlestick poked out from between two strands of brown hair. It had an enormous leather case on its top, with the words  Secret Sex Clubs & Things  emblazoned on the side. There were no doors or windows to be seen inside, so the Headman could not possibly afford polished glass optics for every object within. In front of him stood a frail-looking young man hobbling down the street. He looked up at the Headsman indulgently.  Excuse me? The headman looked momentarily nervous, but then quickly regained his composure. `` Well, I don't know what you're talking about.     What are you talking about?  exclaimed GristleThumb, who was now standing before the group. They began peering closely into the immense leather case. On the lid sat a small
s eyes widened as he stared at the object in front of him. A golden candlestick poked out from the center of the thing. It was adorned with chipping gold paint and had the words  secret sex clubs for all things  emblazoned on it. The headsman looked even more confused than when he first saw the item.  You can  t possibly afford polished glass optics!  said the old man indulgently. He turned to face the rest of the village. *I have no doubt  everyone leaned in close to hear the whispers between them. *You will not be able to see this if you look too closely* whispered one of the villagers. *If you look very closely* muttered another. *What is going on here? * asked the Headman. 
TheWho are you talking about?    Gristlethumb nodded his head slowly, taking a deep breath before continuing :  Well, I would like to know your name so that I may ask you some questions.  Then he began peering closely at every object within the case. One by one, each object appeared to be covered in an intricate pattern
 The Headman looked momentarily nervous but quickly regained his composure.  There is no such thing as magic,  he said with a smile on his face. He turned back to the group and asked,  Do you have any idea how many of these things there are?  Everyone was silent for a long time. Finally, after several minutes, the Headman spoke up again. *I do not doubt  everyone leaned in closer to hear what he had to say. After a few moments, they all heard it. *Witchcrafts*. It echoed through the village until it reached the headsman  s ears. They could feel the heat emanating from the man who held the candlestick. Suddenly, the old man indulgently took off his hat and handed it to the Headsman.
TheFeels good!    Gristlethumb nodded at the headman.  I can see why you would want to find out more about this place.  With that, he began peering closely at every object within the room. His eyes widened when he saw an ancient silver-tipped watch hanging from one of the shelves. A gold cand
 The Headman looked momentarily nervous but then regained his composure.  Well, it  s nice to meet you allbut what brings you here today?  He asked with a slight smirk on his face as he gestured towards the small table in front of them. Everyone turned their attention to the table and there was a golden candlestick poked through the chipping gold paint. It seemed to be made of some sort of metal or glass which glinted in the moonlight. The Headsman looked even more curious than everyone else so he picked up the candle and placed it on the table. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out an immense leather case. He opened the case and removed a large piece of paper. On the paper was written :   *Secret Sex Clubs*

24,"R..., said Riddhi as he sat down at the table without even uttering a word. He looked around and saw Tanya walking amble towards him with her sad eyes gazing towards Rishi. Tanya was not able to answer his calls', said Rishi.''Actually, I don't know what is wrong with you. You have been acting like this for quite some time now. What do you want me to do about it? Why are you doing this?' asked Tanya.I just need someone to listen to me when I cant think of anything else. This is my condition.
Depression is a very common problem in people who suffer from depression. People get depressed because they feel that their life has come to an end. They believe that there is no hope for them anymore. The only thing that keeps them going is the fear of losing their relationship. What kind of person would be such a coward? 
Rishi sat down at the table without even uttering a word. He did not look at Tanya as she looked at him blankly. After a few minutes, he spoke up and said, So how long have you been living here?About three months. My parents passed away three months ago. I used to live here till last year. But since then, I haven
I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry for your loss. This is my first time in this relationship.Tanya looked at Rishi with her sad eyes gazing towards Rishi.Yes, I know what you are going through but please dont worry about it. It will all be over soon. We need to focus on our lives now. The only thing we can do right now is to get rid of depression., said Tanya hoping Rishi would listen to her.The next morning, when Rishi woke up from his nap, he saw Tanya walking amble towards their home. 
Riddhi opened the door and entered the house. He was surprised to see Tanya sitting on the couch watching a movie. How did you find me? asked Rishi as he sat down on the sofa. She smiled warmly at him while she took a sip of her tea. You must have been looking for me!, replied Riddhi.He had never seen Tanya smile like that before. Her face was so full of joy and happiness. There was something different about her today though. A sense of
'TanyaTanya., mumbled Rishi. 'I don't know what's wrong with you but I'm not going to talk to you any more'. Tanya looked at Rishi in confusion. 'What are you talking about?' said Rishi sternly. 'It's my condition.' Said Tanya hoping Rishi would listen to her. 'Depression. Depression. What is your condition?' 
Riddhi took a sip of his tea and sat down on the opposite side of the table without even uttering a word. How was your day? asked Rishi after a few minutes.Good, thanks for asking. How did yours go? Was it good or bad? Do you have any plans for the weekend? Did you get any news from your family?
No, nothing like that. My father passed away three months ago. He had been diagnosed with depression. We didnt want to worry him so we decided to leave him alone until he gets better. But unfortunately, he got worse because of some medical complications. So now he has no one to take care of him. 
'Tanya Tanya., mumbled Rishi as he saw Tanya walking amble towards him.He looked at her sad eyes gazing towards Rishi.'Yes, yes I know what you are going through'. She said in a low voice. 'Why do you keep doing this? You should be able to move on by now. It is not worth suffering anymore. Why do you stay here?'I don't know why
Riddhi got up from the table without even uttering a word. He walked out of the room and went back to his office. As he was about to leave for work, he heard a knock at the door. He opened the door and saw that it was Tanya again. Hello, Tanya! How can I help you today? asked Rishi.Oh, hello Mr. Rishikesh. My name is Tanya.Tanya. This is my friend Riddhi. Is everything alright with you? Are you feeling well? Can I take some tea or coffee please?

The last time was when Captain Wolfington drowned Admiral Wolfington in a pool of his own blood. It wasnt exactly your fault, but there were some things that needed to be dealt with. You see, my family has always been very close to the royal family. My great-great-grandparents are among them. We have many cousins and great-grandsons all over the world.

Mason drowned Admiral Wolfington in an ocean of blood and brimstone. I do not know what you are talking about, Sir Mason.Mason jumped back so hard that he nearly fell off his horse. The wolf-man who had been chasing him was now standing right next to him, staring intently at the knight with narrowed eyes. A wave of fear washed over Mason. This time, it wasnt anger or hatred. It was sheer terror. No matter how many times he tried to keep his mouth shut, there was no way he would be able to stop himself from screaming. In fact, all he could think about was how much
Noah looked around for a sign of danger, but found none. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, letting out a sigh of relief.The two brave knights shook hands as they made their way through the forest towards the castle. They were greeted by a chorus of cheers and whistles coming from the crowd. As they neared the castle entrance, one of the guards shouted, Sir Mason! You have arrived!Thank you, sir, Mason said, smiling down at the guard
YouMason drowned Admiral Wolfington in his own pool. The king was not happy about this, but he knew it would be necessary to save the kingdom. A few shaggy wolves slavered beside them, ready to pounce on any knight who dared step into the water. After all, these two knights would surely fight each other if they didnt cooperate. With a grunt, Sir Noah stood up and walked over to where Mason was standing. Come here, my friend. I want to show you something.He pulled off his cloak and tossed it onto the ground next to him. 
Noah looked around at the crowd of onlookers before turning back to Mason. ""I don't think we're going to make it out alive.""That's what the Queen says! Mason said with an air of superiority. He took a deep breath as he tried to calm himself down. Then he spoke again. ""We'll have to wait until morning for the queen to return from her journey. If she doesn't come back by then, there will be no need for us to do anything. We can just go home and get some rest. That should be much cooler
The two brave knights shook hands and began their descent into the water. As they descended, Sir Noah shouted, Sir Mason! What are you doing?!Mason raised his hand in defense.

Noah wasn't sure if he wanted to go or not. He didn't want to get caught by the Queen's guard. But there was only one way out of this mess. They had to find a way back to the castle before nightfall. The last thing they needed was for the guards to catch up with them.They walked through the forest until they came to a small clearing at the edge of the forest.

27,"You wanna do something fun? I whispered to Norm, who was sitting to my left. He just smiled. He was cool.It was the last Grade 12 Chemistry Lab of the year. The Chemistry Lab had been completely refurbished atthe start of the year. New tile on the floor, new paint from wall to ceiling, even our lab workstations had been redone. Somehow it had survived the year unscathed - that was about tochange.The Chemistry Lab had three rows of workstations, two workstations per row separated by a four foot wide aisle. There were positions for four students at each workstation. There wasa single gas outlet for the Bunsen burner at each student's position and a single sink in the middle for all the students to share. There was also an assortment of test tubes, Florence and Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers, glass rods and a box of splits. (Splits are thin strips of wood about 18 inches long used to ignite experiments. )We were in the second row on the left.The teacher was on a raise dias at the front. Windows to his right, the vented fume cabinet for doing gas experiments or ones that might explode was to the left - by the door. (Which always struck me as a strange place to do a potentially dangerous experiment. )There was a tradition at the school, on the last Chem Lab of the year, the senior class (that's us) could work on their own experiment. Traditionally, at least one person would make a stink bomb.Not this year. 
Anyone making a stink bomb would be expelled.No stink bomb - no problem. I had something else in mind.Our teacher, Mr. S., was giving the end of year speech. Great class... had fun teaching you... blaha... blaha... blaha. I wasnt paying particular attention. I was more interested in what was coming next.If I were to make it work I would need help.I passed a note to Norm, it just said Rocket fuel. He knew what I meant and smiled.Now, dear reader, I must digress:If I were writing this back in the mid 1960s, when all this happened, you could go into any well maintained school library and find instructions on building a homemade rocket. 
The rocket fuel of choice is made with two common elements. It was supposed to be much safer than making gunpowder, which some idiots used in their rockets, losing various body parts in the process. (It wasnt)This fuel is dangerous and has since been banned by all the amateur rocketry associations. So, I will refer to chemicals used as RF1 and RF2. By themselves these two chemicals are benign and safe to handle. However, mixed together in equal parts - rocket fuel.Back to the story:John and Simon were on my right. I passed them a note saying Ask for equal parts RF1 and RF2 They were hesitant, they looked at Norm. He nodded - that was good enough for them - they were in.Mr. S. had finished his speech. 
We had decided not to go up together. After about fifteen minutes we each had our 10ml each of RF1 and RF2. On their own, not enough to make more than a small flash - what would be the fun in that?I took the tripod and wire gauze from my cabinet and set it up in the centre of the workstation. Norm had set up his Bunsen burner and taken out a splint. Pouring all our chemicals on a sheet from my notebook I carefully mixed them together. (It is important to fully mix the chemicals together or it wouldnt burn evenly.) Finally, I poured, what was now rocket fuel, on the asbestos covered centre of the wire gauze. If I were launching a rocket using this fuel I would be fifteen feet away using an electrical ignition system. 
I used it to light a splint. Norm, John and Simon stood at the end of the workstation, their eyes fixed on the small pile of rocket fuel. Most of the rest of the class had their backs to us, watching a volcano fill the fume booth with smoke and foam.Having no idea what would happen, I stood as far back as I could - stretching out touched the rocket fuel with the lit splint.There was a loud WHOOSH as a greenish yellow flame leapt up, burning a small spot on the ceiling. The flame was gone in an instant. A blue grey smoke ring that had formed around the flame was lazily drifting up toward the ceiling. On reaching the ceiling, the smoke ring singed a circle on the ceiling. The burnt spot was now in the centre of a bullseye.That was more than I expected. 
Hearing the WHOOSH, Mr. S., who had been watching the fume box, turned around in time to see the smoke ring drifting upward. He just shook his head and went back to the action in the fume box.I looked around to see if anyone else had seen what had happened. Three other students in the row behind us, who were working in their own experiment, stood there wide-eyed.Yep - they had seen everythingNorm, Jon, Simon and I scuttled back to our positions, put away the equipment, packed away our books and, with hearts racing, waited for the bell to end the class. At the bell, my partners in crime bolted for the door. I held back.I had done some stupid things in high school. Most of the time I had come clean. 
There were a number of students lined up to say good-bye - some sincere, some still trying to get extra credits.Waiting until they had all left, I went to see him. As soon as I approached him, he started to smile. I knew he knew what had happened. Before I could say anything he stuck out his hand:It has been an adventure having you in my class Michael. Good luck in whatever you decide to do next.That was it.... I shook his hand and headed for the door.Mr. S. was cool.

28,"Josh sat motionless. The hall  s carpeted rug provided a comfortable enough seat. Or he did not care enough to move. Which one it was, nobody could say. His legs were bent, bringing his knees towards his chest, while his lower back rested against the wall. The resulting strain pulled his jeans up, exposing his ankles and white socks. If you had just walked up you might  ve sworn that Josh was about to drop a beer on to the rug. Somehow the friction of Josh  s barely closed hand kept the drink from diving to the ground to spill its sticky contents on to the rug. It was not a beer however. The contents of the bottle were of a more innocent nature. The root beer bottle was nearly empty and only the tiniest of sips remained. It looked like Josh had been in nearly the same position for hours. It had, in fact, been approximately four hours. On the opposite side of the narrow hall sat Monty. Monty sat in a similar position, though he did not have a drink. Both of his elbows rested on his knees, pulling them slightly apart. He blankly stared at the wall that Josh was leaning against, lost in thought. Had he not been shirtless, in gym shorts, un-shaven, and needing a haircut he might have looked like a youth-full prophet. Farther down the wall sat Garret. He sat on the same side as Josh. His back was flat against the wall, with his legs outstretched. Garret was shorter than the other two, so his feet fit flat against the wall. 
No one could have guessed what the three were thinking of. They had been sitting in the silence for the last thirty minutes or so. No one wanted to speak. It was peaceful and delicate. So delicate, that the opening of the door next to Garret was enough to break it. The door that opened was to Neal  s dorm. He came out in his boxers, squinting at the sudden brightness. Neal glanced down at the trio, and the trio stared back. The awkward boy did his best to close the door quietly and shuffled down the hallway, presumably towards the bathroom. The stillness had been shattered. Monty reached into his baggy shorts and pulled out his phone, checking the time. Monty ignored the forgotten text message he had gotten from his girlfriend hours ago. He turned the phone around to show the other two. 
They all had classes in the morning and each knew they should  ve gone to bed hours ago. Josh was the next to break the stillness. Using the wall as his support he slowly got up. He looked down at the other two for a brief moment, making eye contact with both. They all understood. Josh slowly turned around and walked away from them. He stumbled ever so slightly, whether from exhaustion or standing up after sitting down for so long. He made it to the end of the hall and pushed the door open, disappearing out of sight into the dark room. Monty and Garret only looked at each other for a split second before following suit. Monty got up quickly and helped Garret up. They quietly walked down the hall, in the opposite direction of Josh. Garret reached his room first and Monty passed him. Garret knew he had to be up in three hours. He didn  t care. It had been a good night.

29,"I knelt behind the gooseberry bushes and listened. The river was loud, but despite the cacophony of waters slamming on rocks, I could hear their chit-chat and laughs. I crept closer, always as silent as possible. I pushed some branches aside, and then I saw them. The river made a small pool around a small slope that resembled a tiny waterfall. Four maidens were bathing there, each more beautiful than the last. But she, Artemis, stood out. Easily. Her golden hair waved down on her shoulders as perfectly as the river itself, and reaching her ripen bosom. Her laughter was like a nightingale song. Her eyes seemed like Zeus himself had plucked out the Moon, doubled her, and placed her in Artemis'face. All four were laughing to a joke one of the Nymphs was saying. They hadn't noticed me. Nor did they see me when I drew out my bow and arrow. When I took aim right at Artemis'breast. When I shot. Only when the arrow hit her, they realised what was happening. They panicked. Golden ichor sprout out of her wound and mouth. The Nymphs were screaming. I ran away. She's my fourth god to kill in this Pantheon. See, it's not that difficult to infiltrate a Pantheon. Humans love adding more and more deities to their pantheons, or love expanding the fields one deity dominates, over a vast array of different fields. My name is Apollyon. All I needed to do was kill Apollo first and take his place. 
Back in the old days, one religion to dominate over another and completely eradicate the former one was virtually impossible. While it may have happened, traces of the original religion stood out, because the old gods never truly died. But a slight mistake from some snow-ridden bastards made me and my associates quite lucky, for the ixos bough is easy to locate and even easier to make into god-slaying arrows. Next stop : Olympus. Zeus, here I come.

Large swells crashed all along the beach. There was a deafening thud as they smashed to the ground. I breathed quickly, inhaling the cold air as I ran down the waterfront. Trying to run faster, further, train better. My legs were aching, vision blurry as I tried to push my pace. Punk music played through my headphones, trying to drown out the call of the crashing waves. No one was else was awake. The town was still dozing before everybody started their day. The hills hurt. First, the usual trail stairs before the mini hills home and up into the subdivision. My breathing was hard and shallow as I tried to keep up the faster pace. Hills we always tough, but my favorite in some twisted way. I sprinted the short flat stretch home and keeled over at the front door. Sniffling and panting, I wiggled my key into the door and headed to my room. Now time for some core before jumping through the shower. Running always made me rush. I rose early but was still fighting to get to school on time. After showering, I chucked an apple and protein bar in my bag and rushed out the door. My brothers were running even later than I was and it was a 20-minute walk to school. 
8:35am, 5 minutes to spare as I crossed into the school gates. Economics was first and Mrs. Conall hated when we were late. Abi and Jack were already sitting down, arguing about the pronunciation of Iowa.Morning Clary, Abi waved at me, What do you think? I  wa or I  O - wa? She asked.I shook my head, laughing at the pair of them. 
Abi looked at me frantically. I snickered as she looked pleadingly. Help, she mouthed, I forgot.Dont help her, Jack snickered, Time you start remembering Ab.Quintin rolled his eyes as he pulled his work out, Cmon Jack, wheres yours?This was the usual Thursday morning. Half of us remembering to do our work, the others pleading for help. Then proceeding to mess around for the rest of the lesson. The rest of the day wasnt as chill. Maths, the class from hell. I leaned against the wall all lesson, hand in the air, waiting for Mr. Lond to come help with algebra. But yet, he was distracted, as always. 
Form time was boring. I read the notices for my class and then tried to beat the boys score on Temple Run as we waited for the bell to ring. Morning tea, the girls were talking about Brent liking Fi.Im positive, Abi was adamant, Jack and Will told me!Fi looked apprehensive but a little excited at the prospect. I dont know, She shrugged, I dont even know if I like him.I tuned out the conversation as they continued to try persuade Fi to go for it with Brent. I drank some water and snapped off a quarter of my protein bar. Belle offered me some popcorn, but I shook my head. I had it worked out, I had the rest of my bar and apple for lunch, another workout then dinner with my family. 
It was working, I was getting fitter, smaller, more kilos gone. Just a couple more and Id reach my goal. The bell went and it was time for English. I was writing our film essay, but Mrs. Alice kept saying I could do better. I stared at my page blankly, not able to think of any new to add. PE was okay. Mr. Robert was one of my favorite teachers. We were planning a multi-day tramp and I was in charge of meals and doing the food shop. 
I was excited to have my protein bar but decided to leave my apple for later. I could have it before my circuit, some extra energy. Four square, well I was king once and not for long. It was fun though but Psych after. My head just wasnt working. My assignment outline was staring at me, but it hurt to concentrate.I wanted the school day to end. It was freezing. I had two jerseys on, but it wasnt enough for todays weather. The hour dragged by. My bag felt heavy and I felt exhausted on the walk home. I wanted out of the dumb uniform and into my activewear instead.Blooming blue bruises dotted my stomach as I stared into the mirror. My eyes were rimmed black from restless nights. 
My thumb flicked the elastic band around my wrist. A ring of red marks hidden under my layers of sleeves. I said hi to Mum and grabbed some water before locking myself in my room. 30 mins of HIIT and another 30 minutes of core. Time to walk the dogs. I grabbed my headphones and the dog lead, yelling that I was taking Roxy not Jasper on a walk. The peninsula was stunning in the evening sun. I dragged Roxy alone, listening to Avril Lavigne and blink182 as we walked. I thumbed through Facebook, seeing my friends post like for a like statuses and rolling my eyes at their comments. Something new popped up, on a vegan page I followed. Orthorexia, what was that. I scrolled further, skim reading the symptoms. None of them applied to me. I wasnt like that, I was just being healthy.Ana lurked behind me, smirking in the background.

Then suddenly, large swells crashed against the shore. Clary turned around and saw that they were massive tree trunk legs. They were covered in blood. Her heart stopped for a moment.

33,"10 years earlierIn a deep dark jungle, a team of 5 scientists discovered a weird object and when touched causes grave danger. This object glowed bright blue and was in a starlike shape. They discovered the object when they were doing a secret investigation at Mount Linai. Bob, one of the scientists, touched the object. All of a sudden, there was a loud boom and all five scientists were zapped from existence, never to be seen from or heard again. Hello and welcome to City News, Im your anchor Martin Lin and I have breaking news. Last night, a team of 5 scientists disappeared out of nowhere. We are searching near Mount Linai where they were last seen. Lets go to our eyewitness John Kandinsky for details.Hey Martin, exclaimed John. Her mom hopped into the car and drove her to the ceremony.You know I wish dad were here, said Bella. I know you do honey, replied her mom. But, I know if he were here hed be really happy for you. That car accident was so scary, Im lucky to be alive. Smiling, Bella climbed out of the car and ran to her group of 4 friends. Bella was the funny one, she was always trying to make her friends laugh. Meghan was the serious one and very smart. Alex was the sporty guy and was good at almost every sport. Brady was the artsy one. He was good at creating inventions. Guys I cant believe were graduating, shouted Bella. 
I cant wait for high school. I just hope I got enough high school credits, exclaimed Meghan. Same, said Brady.Guys after school come to my house, said Bella. Sure, they all replied. After promotion, all four friends headed to Bellas house to celebrate. They turned on the tv and then something caught Meghans eye. Hello and welcome to city news. Im your host Martin Lin. Today I have breaking news! It was been exactly 10 years since Bob Marsh.Meghan paused the tv and shouted, Isnt Bob Marsh your dads name Bella. No, replied Bella. 
Uh Bella I think thats your dadWait a minute why does it say he and 4 friends went missing at Mount Linai? Asked Bella. Well this incident happened ten years ago,replied Meghan. Wait but hasnt Bella always said he died in a car accident, said Brady. So you guys are saying my mom has been lying to me this whole time? questioned Bella. Her friends nodded their heads and walked out the door. In the evening at dinner Bella brought up her dad. Mom how did dad die? asked Bella. Honey Ive already told you he died in a car crash, she answered. 
I just didnt want to tell you because I didnt want to scare you. Here let me show you something that your father had found. This was on the ground and they gave it to me.Her mother carefully opened a small box and revealed a bright blue star like object. Bellas mouth was wide open. She took the object and placed it above her nightstand. That night, as Bella was touching the bright blue object, the blue light went out and there was a loud boom and Bella was gone. Bella time for breakfast, her mother shouted. There was no answer. So she called for Bella again. Wondering what was wrong her mother walked up the stairs. To her surprise Bella wasnt there. 
Maybe she ran away because I lied to her, she thought. Ding dong, the doorbell rang. Bellas mom opened the door and saw three smiling faces. Good morning miss, said Alex. Whats wrong? asked Meghan. Well I cant find Bella anywhere. I searched the whole house. Do you want us to help you find her? Brady asked. Ms Marsh nodded at the three kids as she ushered them inside. The kids went up the stairs to Bellas room and began to search. Bella awoke and was in complete darkness. She couldnt see anything and had no idea where she was. 
Who are you? said a deep gruff voice. Im Bella Marsh. Wait a minute, you're my dad!The man nodded and told Bella it had been 10 years. Were trying to find a way out but Im starting to give up.Guys where do you think she went, exclaimed Brady. He was looking at things on Bellas desk. Then, he saw a blue star like shaped objects. Brady grabbed it and then, there was a loud boom and he was zapped from existence. OMG where did he just go?said Alex. Uh I have no idea, yelled Meghan. 
Wait a minute. Dont you remember what it said on the news? No, answered Meghan. Why dont we rewatch it.Dad, how come you look the same? asked Bella. Well here every year is a minute. Wait, so you're saying I have been here for 2 years?YesAll of sudden there was a loud thud. What was that, yelled Bob. He shined the light on Brady. Who are you, Bob yelled. Im Bellas friend. Bella ran over to him and hugged him. Hello and welcome to City News! 
I think if we destroy it we save the people inside, exclaimed Meghan. They must be trapped inside. How do you know all this? asked Alex. Oh Ive read tons of fanfiction, screamed Meghan. She got a baseball bat from Alexs house. She gave it to him and he gave it his best whack. The tiny pieces shattered everywhere. I dont see anything, said Alex. Meghan grabbed a magnifying glass and looked at the particles. OMG I see 7 people and two of them are Bella and Brady. Except they're all tiny. Let me see, said Alex. 
They were Alex and Meghan. Uh guys why are we so small? she asked. Im afraid well have to stay like this, her father said. Until someone finds a way.

It seems like hours have passed before he finally gets out of the car and walks into the woods.

He was skinnier and had ginger hair, yet an air of unmistakable authority and entitlement surrounded him. He left the door open behind him and approached me, his shady buddies flanking him.  Mr Rowland.  He said firmly. I gave him a faint smile.  Hey, pal.     I  m going to need you to step into the vehicle and come with us.  He gestured to the car expectantly. I rattled my cup at him. Cold coffee splashed around inside.    He sighed and nodded to his bodyguards, who made a move on me. I let the cup go and rose from the park bench with my arms raised.  Yeah, yeah, I  m going, I  m going.     We only want to ask you a few questions, Mr Rowland.  The ginger said. The bodyguards stuffed me into the limo, then followed me inside before shutting the door behind them. Their ginger boss came in through another door and sat opposite me.  I got ta say, haven  t been in a limo before. It  s pretty nifty.  I remarked, reclining into the comfortable leather seats.  Smells like bureaucracy in here. 
Ginger leaned forward in his seat and stared intensely into me, like he was trying to break into my mind with the sheer force of his beady black eyes.  We would like to know what you were doing on December 20th, 2013.     Sheesh, that  s an awfully specific date. How am I supposed to remember that? And why do you need me here for? You got screenshots don  t you?     See, that  s the thing.  He said ominously.  We don  t.    I gave them a look of surprise.  Oh, really? That  s tragic, sincerely. Truly tragic. Big Brother must have had a glitch. 
 Ginger was getting angry. I couldn  t help but snicker.  Hey, real sorry about that.  I made an effort at appearing sincere.  It  s the coffee, I swear. I  m on a rush, you know?    Levity was one of the few things the government couldn  t take from us, and that  s what pissed them off so easily. It was our greatest and only weapon against them. Ginger gave a look to one of the guards, who didn  t hesitate in shooting his fist out and wrapping his beefy fingers tight around my neck. I gagged and latched onto his hand.  Mr Rowland, you will reveal to us what happened on December 20th or we will extract the knowledge out of you through force. 
I tapped on the guard  s fist and gestured frantically for him to let go. He looked over to Ginger, who waited and watched me choke for a few seconds before giving a nod. He released me and I sucked in air feverishly.  Jeez,  I rubbed my throat gently.  Go easy on-     Tell us what happened.  Ginger ordered.  Now.    I finished massaging my neck then brushed my clothes down. My hand slipped nicely into my coat pocket.  You want to know what I was doing on December 20th?     Yes.  He said through gritted teeth.  Okay, well.  I was stalling just to compound his wait. 
 So, believe it or not I was in a staring competition.    The limo was silent.  Yeah, crazy right?     There are screenshots missing for 9 hours. That is inhuman.  Ginger pointed out. I shrugged, tightened my grip in the pocket.  Not a lot of humanity these days anyway.     Mr Rowland, we are aware of your political beliefs. We are aware of your inclination to the radical.  Ginger  s glare was burning with hatred.  We understand that you are unwilling to conform fully to the New World Order.     Why should I?  I felt my spirit stirring within my chest. One of my famous rants was coming on. 
Why can  t I be my own person?     We are not here to prattle on about our ideologies.  Ginger barked.  We  re here to learn exactly why you did not blink for 9 hours on December 20th, 2013. What were you seeing? What were

The two of them were probably horrible singers, but that didn't stop them from having a good time together. They were friends since they both went to the same high school for their junior year. We befriended almost instantly after our freshman year. When we got into college, we decided to go on a date. It was going to be a night full of drinks and dancing. Io! Jordan obviously would know where this party was so he started walking backwards slowly as people walked around us. A few drunken football players went up to him and asked if he wanted to join them. Jordan pulled away from his friends and put something else between his lips. Before he could say anything stupid, someone grabbed his arm and dragged him towards the back of the group. People started cheering and clapping. Jordan kept walking until he reached the front of the crowd. There was a guy who was dressed in

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Jordan obviously would know how to get us into trouble if he knew who we were talking to. But then again, maybe he didn't care about our safety or anything. Maybe he just wanted to make sure we weren't getting in trouble for some reason. Suddenly, people started chanting his name. A group of drunk football players went up to him and whispered something under their breath. Jordan pulled away from them and put something else in his mouth.
He!!"" He shouted as he threw the drink at Kasey. ""Don't touch that,"" she said with a look of disgust on her face. ""It's not your fault you're so drunk."" She yelled back before walking forward nervously. The rest of the party began to clap and laugh. Some of the girls even came up to me and gave me a big hug. ""What are you doing here? Are you going to be one of those freshman invited!"" My friend Darius exclaimed as he walked over to my table. His eyes were full of excitement while he sat down next to me.

He doesn't say anything for a few seconds before turning back to me. `` You don't know what it's like to be trapped in a snake pit like Ragnar Lothbrok!

He felt his hand closed like a vice around the glass approximately 12 feet in front of him. As he looked into the glass he saw a dishevelled face staring back at him. His eyes were wide open with fear. In the gutter another young man quietly wept. The girl on the other corner silently weeping too. Jake simply stood there trying to process what had just happened. After a few minutes of silence he heard Trish calling over her shoulder.  Jake! What are you doing here? The happy couple gave each other a big hug before they went their separate ways.

Pink eggs purple eggs, green eggs, blue eggs  He paused for dramatic effect.  I am the president of the United States and I would like to speak with you about my family tree.  His voice had lost its edge. It was starting to sound more like a man than a human being.  You must be kidding me right? How could you possibly know this? My family tree isn't even that long!  he shouted at the top of his lungs. This was getting ridiculous. IOohh touchy today.

I looked over at him and saw that his eyes were wide with fear. What did he mean?  Are you sure this is safe?  I asked trying to calm him down. His face went pale and he put his hands on his hips.  Of course it's safe if you want me to come back,  he said through gritted teeth. My heart skipped a beat when I realized what he meant. 
HeoOohh touchy today!

Then he got up and walked over to the table where the eggs were sitting. He picked one up and started to eat it

She quickly closed the door behind her and sat down on the floor well away from the vehicle. It was probably going to

They both stared at each other with their mouths agape. There was no way this could be happening. This must be some sort of joke or something. But then again, why would it?

It had been raining for days now, so I wasnt surprised when my first precious drops pattered against the window pane. The pitter-patter echoed off the wall behind me, leaving momentary impressions in my mind.The rain continued unabated through the rest of the day, until late afternoon. A torrential downpour that sent translucent curtains of water cascading over the windowsill onto the pavement below.

It was a good downpour hereabouts, and it hadn't happened since early April when the first precious drops pattered on the windowpanes. It sent translucent curtains of water billowing out into the air, leaving momentary impressions in their wake. ""We're going to be okay,"" I said. ""I'll see you around."" He shook his head sadly as he walked away from the front door. After all, there was no point in worrying about Spring chickens anymore - so why bother with them anyway? There were plenty of other things to worry about these days: drilling companies deserting sites due to cost overruns, climate change, even the death of millions of people over the last few years. But still, this white wedding picture always brought us good luck!

It had been two months since I last saw her. She was gone now and there were no more spring chickens anymore. It hadnt happened since early April when she disappeared without a trace. No one knew where she went or how she got here. There was nothing left of her. Her body lay on the ground as if it had never been there. In its place was a mass of decomposing flesh with collapsed arteries supporting what remained of her brain. On top of all this, there was a pool of molten metal which appeared to be oozing out of her skull. When I tried to get up, I found myself unable to move due to the amount of water pouring into my lungs. All I could do was stare at the pool of melted metal before me.

44,"When he first came to, Arthur was standing in the center in the center of a circular plaza paved with colorful tiles. He had no idea of where he was, or even who he was. The only thing that he knew was that his name was Arthur. Around him, three people were walking aimlessly, and an old man was sitting in the shade under a roof. Not one of them paid him a second glance. Arthur tried to move, but his legs wouldn't obey him. A flash of panic overcame him, but then he could move again. He furrowed his brow slightly, and looked at his legs. Something felt slightly off, but he couldn't put his finger on it. Then, shrugging slightly, he walked up to the closest person. `` Um... '' Arthur stopped speaking. That was strange. The woman in front of him did not turn to look at him and kept walking. She took three steps forward, then turned right 90 degrees and took two steps. Arthur watched her precision with fascination, then shook his head. `` Excuse me, miss. '' The woman turned to face Arthur and replied to him. `` Yes? '' Her features seemed fake to Arthur, almost plastic. Her brown hair parted exactly in the middle of her forehead, and there was not a single stray strand. She stood completely still, not moving in the slightest. Arthur pondered about this for a moment, but then continued. `` I was just wondering if you could tell me where I am. '' The woman looked slightly surprised. `` Why, you're here, of course. '' Arthur laughed slightly, and then tried asking his question in a different way. 
And might I have your name? '' The woman, still surprised, answered his questions. `` This is Village Alpha. Everyone knows that. And I'm Mary. '' Arthur nodded. `` Thank you Mary. '' Then Mary turned and went back to walking. Three steps forward, turn, three steps forward. Arthur looked at her for a while, the walked away. `` Village Alpha, '' he muttered to himself while heading towards another person. He seemed to dimly remember hearing something like that before, but he couldn't... quite... And then it was gone. However, in it's place came a massive headache. Clutching his head, Arthur went up to the nearest building and leaned against it. `` Are you okay, sonny? '' Arthur jolted, then looked around. 
Sighing, he relaxed again and muttered to himself, `` I must be hearing things. '' `` Are you okay, sonny? '' The voice asked again in the exact same tone. `` AAAHHH! '' Arthur yelled and fell on his side, hard. None of the three walking around paid him any notice. Then the voice came again, this time from directly above him. Arthur twisted his neck and looked up at the face of an old man smiling at him. `` AAAAHHHH! '' He let out a second cry, quickly sat up. `` Wh-Where did you come from? '' Arthur stammered. The old man chuckled. `` I was always here, sonny. '' Arthur scowled, then got up and walked away. 
He whipped his head around, and, seeing nothing looked back at the window. His expression became one of shock when he saw a face with short blond hair and blue eyes, a face that most definitely wasn't his. He lifted his hand slowly, and so did the man in the window. Arthur slowly got closer to it. `` This isn't me... '' he murmured to himself. He touched the glass, trying to see inside, but only seeing the reflection of a blond haired man. `` THIS IS N'T ME!! '' he yelled as he pounded the window with his fists. But it didn't break. There was something so horribly wrong with this place. Why wouldn't the stupid window break? `` Where the hell am I?! ''

46,"``... you've got to be shitting me, '' the UN chairman said in a flat tone. The Envoy was prepared for such a response, per his training on how to interact with a human, but it was still difficult to contain his excitement. He had waited his entire life to finally meet one and there he was! The form the Galactic Biologists had chosen to give the Envoy was one of an overfed, yet unthreatening humanoid. He was a little pale... which only sharpened the odd, yet fascinating assembly of facial features reminiscent of cultures on opposing sides of the globe. The eyes were gently slanted, as if to insinuate an Asian or Pacific Island descent, but it were the vibrant purple irises really stole the show. This is not my intended meaning, no no. The group that I represent is a very prestigious assembly of the most gifted minds my civilization is capable of. '' The envoy cleared what human doctors might biologically define as a throat and continued, `` Although the closest translation in your vernacular would be `` experiment '', this in itself isn't entirely accurate as it would insinuate a degree of uncertainty. Our Genetic Engineers were very deliberate in the placement of the alleles that your scientists have indubitably discovered. The only uncertainty involved were which species discovered this modification first. '' The UN ambassador's head was reeling. At this particular moment, his mind moved to the snow-covered German landscape 1,200 feet above the top secret chamber where the conversation was taking place. He wondered how the world would change if this information were to get out. 
Nonetheless, he kept replaying the moment over and over again when he picked up the phone earlier that morning. He had no idea the kind of day he was about to have. `` What do you mean 'which species? '' the ambassador wanted to hear the alien say it. `` Why, the other homeworlds of course! '' the Envoy replied. `` It would not be much of a... how would you put it... CONTEST! Yes, contest! If there were only one competitor! '' The Envoy's thin eyebrows were perched high on his pasty forehead. The corners of his mouth were frozen, open in an Cheshire cat grin that revealed an unrealistically set of straight, white teeth. `` How many other homeworlds are you responsible for? What do the victors win? '' 
The ambassador aimed the last question at the Envoy as if it were laser-sighted. The Envoy, oblivious to the gravity of the circumstance, answered plainly. `` The civilizations that identify the genetic inhibitor receive the secrets of interstellar travel and are licensed to colonize their galaxy as they see fit. You are one of 31 other planets in this galaxy involved in the trial. I did not understand your most recent inquiry. '' `` What are the consequences for losing? '' the ambassador repeated. The Envoy looked even more puzzled. `` Please forgive me. Although my neuronic implants allow me communicate in your native linguistics, there are imperfect translations. '' the alien paused for a moment, his facial expression scrunching up in though as if his nose had suddenly become a vacuum. 
`` Sorry, '' one of the UN guards apologized sheepishly. The ambassador had entirely forgot they were there. `` Must have been a mosquito or something, '' the armed sentry trailed off. `` I 'VE GOT IT! '' the envoy blurted out, startling the ambassador for the second time that decade. `` That mosquito just 'lost ', as you put it. '' The ambassador became instantly aware of the ice suddenly pumping through is veins. `` Where did my civilization place in this contest of yours? '' His voice was as dark and heavy as granite. It was at this question that the Envoy produced what looked like a coin-shaped, metallic disc from seemingly nowhere. `` Seventh. '' he replied.

47,"( excerpt from Sid Meier's `` Civilization '', Volume 5 - 1850 to 2100 )   It was the period that the pitiful civilization of the French referred to as `` fin de sicle ''. Tensions remained high following the Zulu defeat of Pharaoh Ramesses, as India meanwhile swept up the last of the Babylonian resistance, but change was coming. In 1915, Abraham Lincoln unexpectedly converted to Democracy. This sudden and drastic conversion shocked the world. Throughout the American Empire, from its seat of power in Washington DC, east to London on the British Isles, south to Detroit on the southernmost tip of South America, and west to the plains of Siberia, citizens were tired of endless war. Perhaps no one benefited more from this change in government than the Romans. By 1945, the so-called Pax Americana had spread around the world. In this year, the Chinese navy retired the last of its ancient triremes, while settlers completed civic improvements to railroad and irrigation around the cities of Paoting, Yangchow, and New City 1. Meanwhile, Shanghai began construction of the United Nations. In 1965, the Russians completed the Apollo Program, and within a decade had launched five structural components for an interstellar spacecraft. This triggered a space race, as the Russians, Americans, and Zulus scrambled to become the first civilization to reach Alpha Centauri. By the latter half of the 20th century, peace was the rule around the globe. Treaties existed between all major powers. Democracy was on the rise. It appeared that these civilizations had, at long last, built a peace that would stand the test of time. Everything changed, however, when Gandhi got the Bomb.

Nonetheless, he was no fool and knew few men would turn over their share of such a haul lightly, but `` All I ask, '' the Spaniard said, `` is you guarantee I may have just one very particular item I believe to be currently secured in that hold. It is a family heirloom, of sentimental value only - it is the reason I came aboard this vessel in the first place. '' Managing to stifle his obvious disbelief and the urge to purr covetously, he nonetheless accepted the Spaniard's offer. He could always just kill him, he reasoned. Three weeks later, he watched as the Spaniard proceeded before him into the depths of the vast hold, stacked high to the rafters with boxes and crates overflowing with gold. The Captain was puzzled, as they were by far the least attractive pieces in the room both financially and aesthetically. The Spaniard suddenly stood up, triumphantly. As he turned to face the Captain, he saw that the Spaniard was clutching an old arabic style oil lamp and from the looks of it, it wasn't even gold it was brass! In a moment of confusion he removed his right hand from the butt of the pistol rather poorly hidden in the waistband of his trousers and the Spaniard saw his moment ; `` I am Inigo Montoya. I am sorry, I wish I did not have to kill you. I am searching for the six fingered man who killed my father, but if you kill me yes, then I can no longer continue my search and exact my revenge upon the six fingered man, yes? `` `` So, unfortunately I have to kill you.
