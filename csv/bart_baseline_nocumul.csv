0,"The first thing I noticed was the way my hands trembled. Holding the phone, my right hand shook with an uncharacteristic weakness, then as I blearily opened my eyes, it gave up completely, dropping the phone squarely on my face with a solid *thwock. *   I had considered many things. For example, I wasn't exactly young anymore - and the trembling could be the first signs of Parkinson's. Additionally, some of the chemicals I worked with - they could be the cause too. One whiff too many could cause temporary neurological symptoms. It was a cause for concern, but it wasn't until I got up, and looked at my bedside table, that something really strange began to happen. I could have sworn the table was on my *right*. And right there and then I sat bolt upright, sweating in the darkness, then fumbled for the light switch. Everything looked normal, but reversed. It was as if some alien being had folded my room in half and switched around all the contents. Symmetries and chirality had formed a big part of my life, of course - but I was sure I wasn't simply seeing things. Carefully, I walked unsteadily over to my bathroom. There would be a while to sort out this mess, but I had to get dressed for work. My feet felt so awkward, almost as if I were walking on moving ground, almost as if the tiles before me were shifting and shaking at every stroke. And when I turned on the lights in my bathroom I got such a shock that my head spun a little. . I walked closer to the mirror, transfixed like Narcissius, not daring to take my eyes off me. Slowly, I raised my right hand. Mirror-me raised its left hand. Which meant...   Everything else in the world had been mirrored. And I had been left untouched. -- -   I put on my tie and suit as best I could, and looked out my window. The sun was just beginning to rise in the west, and the stray light beams lit up the road before me. And all the cars were on the *right* side of the road - which might have impressed my American colleagues but freaked the hell out of me. Oh God, so it is true, I thought. Everything but me is flipped. Downstairs there was a slowly ticking clock. . All the numbers had been mirrored, so to me, they seemed like some strange alien language. But no matter. I kept staring at it, trying to divine some meaning from the numbers, as I willed the second hand to move. And eventually it did - *counter-clockwise*. Was time running backwards, or did the clock *appear* to move backward? I pulled out my phone from the pocket and held it up to the dry air, dimming the screen. In the mirror-like reflection of the glass the clock appeared to work normally. So it was the clock too that was reflected, everyone and everything else seemed to be flipped. Did physicists know yet? It was then that I spied a letter. The red letter on the table seemed symbolic enough, and I had to use my phone as a mirror again to read the contents. . *Timescape*, it had said. *For all your time travelling needs. *   This was followed by a hastily-scribbled mirrored message on the paper. Again, I put my phone to the message, and it stating only :   *As you might have guessed, your world has been replaced with the mirror image of itself. You are one of the people we suspected might suffer from chiral shock - this idea that left is right and right is left. For the next few days, we advice you to stay away from driving anything, or from trying to operate any heavy machinery, and give yourself time for your body to adjust. Under Alderaanian law, this experiment will take no longer than twenty-five days of your natural suncycle. *   *Best wishes, etc : TimeCorp. *   Gently, I started looking at the clock again. . In reverse. TimeCorp. For all your time travelling needs. For all your-   Oh God. The second realisation struck me like a lightning bolt. The world had become a time machine. -- -   For more stories see /r/KCcracker! . ",,real
1,"Its getting pretty big.Clyde panicked as he stared at his phone. He needed to get out of this house before it started to burn. His least favorite punishment was being forced to sit in the same room for hours while everyone combusts randomly, leaving behind lollipops and candy wrappers on the floor.He didnt want to be stuck in this place forever. What happened?
 
Well, I guess that happens sometimes, Clyde said, trying to appear stoic.Really?! The girl asked, her voice rising with excitement. She looked like she was about to burst into tears. Her hair was tied up in a messy ponytail. I guess it happens sometimes, Clyde said. But I dont want to get caught.Its not your fault! Elizabeth snapped back. She was always the one who had a crush on him. It was her favorite part of his day. After all, she was the only person he could talk to about anything other than work and sports. He tried to appear stoic.Really? she asked. Her eyes were wide with surprise. What are you talking about?Oh, nothing at all. Just some random thing that happened last night. Everyone combusts randomly from time to time. . You know, I dont want you to get pregnant, Elizabeth admitted. I think its a good idea for us to go on a date.Clyde shook his head and said, Itll be fine. Why not?Well, we need to talk about the fact that my best friend is pregnant. She has been dating her boyfriend for months now, and they are getting pretty big."" Clyde panicked at this point. He had no idea how much longer he could hold out until she told him what was going on.What do you mean? Are you telling me that your best friend just got pregnant? You have two kids! . Oh, it happens sometimes, Clyde said. I dont know how to explain it. I just get a little flustered when everyone combusts randomly. Its my least favorite punishment.Well, you should have seen the look on his face when he found out that we were going on a date?Elizabeth smiled at her best friend and continued, He was so shocked! He literally tried stealing candy from every kid in the neighborhood. When he saw me trying to steal lollipops from him, he ran away like a bat out of hell. . s were getting pretty big.Clyde panicked, What are you talking about? You cant be joking!Oh, Clyde said with a sigh, I just thought I could ask you out on a date?Elizabeth smiled and shook her head. No, not at all. Itll be too awkward for both of us. But if you want to try it, we can meet up in the park after school tomorrow. We can have some fun together before heading back to our homes. . I dont know. It happens sometimes, Clyde said. Its not like there is anything I can do about it.Oh, come on, youre a big boy now! You have to take care of yourself!Elizabeth put her hand on his shoulder and pulled him into a hug. She looked at him with concern in her eyes as she tried to appear stoic.Really? he asked.She gave him a look that made him want to punch her again. He wanted to kick her out of the house right then and there. But instead, he just stared at her for a few more seconds before saying, So, what are we going to do about this? . I dont know. I have no idea what you mean, Elizabeth finally said. What do you mean?Clyde looked at her for a moment before saying, Well, my dad died when I was six years old. He... murdered someone.Elizabeths eyes widened and she took a step back from him. She had never seen Clyde so shocked in his life.Oh, that's horrible! he exclaimed. His voice cracked as he tried to appear stoic. . I dont know, it just happens sometimes, Clyde said. Its like when you have a crush on someone and they break up with you in the middle of the night or something. Sometimes everyone combusts randomly.What do you mean? Elizabeth asked.Well, I can see how that would happen to anyone who breaks up with me. But for some reason, this is my least favorite punishment. It makes me feel so guilty about not being able to spend more time with her. And then every day another part of me wants to jump out of my skin and run away from here forever. . It happens sometimes, Clyde said. Everyone combusts randomly and you have to go through a lot of punishment for it. Its my least favorite punishment.I dont know about that, but I think the worst thing is being stuck in here all day with no food or water. The only way we can get out is by riding our bikes around the block every day another part of us gets burned up. And then there are people like me who literally tried stealing candy from the other kids because they were too scared to leave their houses alone. . ",,fake
2,"TW: domestic abuse
What do you want for dinner tonight, Liv? Ryan asks me without even looking at me. I dont know. Whatever you want.
We could try that new place down on 5th. I think its Italian. You love Italian, right?
Yep, love Italian. I hate Italian. Are you hearing me, babe? hes starting to get annoyed. Yeah, sorry, Im just distracted. I glance up from my phone for just a second before scrolling back through the message, willing it to change. I stretch my arms back for him to put my coat on. I stay silent the whole elevator ride down into the garage. I dont say anything until we get into the car. Hey, Ive been meaning to-
Do you like this shirt? I dont know how I feel about the all-black button down.
Yeah, it looks nice, so anyway-
I feel like it makes me look super pale. Maybe we need to go on vacation or something. Or-
Can you just shut up and listen to me for two seconds? I yell. I immediately pale and look out the corner of my eye to see if hes pissed. He looks too shocked to say anything. . Im sorry, sweetie, I just had a really shitty day. I dont mean to take it out on you. I hold my breath while I wait for him to respond. Its fine, he says tight-lipped. What did you want to say?
I swallow. I shouldnt be doing this right now. I just was going to say that my boss probably wouldnt let me take any time off during tax season. Its crazy in the office.
He shakes his head, I still dont know why you insist on working. You dont have to worry about the bills or anything; Ill take care of you.
I fight the urge to roll my eyes. . Its nice to be able to get out of the house and hang out with my friends in the office. I shrug. His fingers tighten on the steering wheel as his knuckles turn white. I turn my head to look out the window at the multitude of cars were passing, their headlights shining through the dense rain. I feel his hand on me and flinch. Sorry, what? His hand goes back on the steering wheel. He heaves a sigh. You know, Liv, I always listen to you whenever you talk. Why cant you give me the same courtesy? I swallow. No answer? My throat feels like its closing and like I couldnt talk even if I wanted to. . I still cant seem to say anything. I just try to keep my heart rate down and not start hyperventilating. I tilt my head down so some hair falls from behind my shoulder to shield my face. I stare at him through my cover. Hes clenching and unclenching his jaw, staring at the cars on his left when he suddenly brakes and turns the wheel all the way to the left for a U-turn. I cant help it, I start to scream because a car is coming directly for my passenger side and doesnt seem to see us. About a foot away from my door the driver makes eye contact with me and slams on his brakes and honks his horn for nearly 30 seconds. Were already in another lane by the time he lets go. I force a few deep breaths. . I didnt mean to make you upset, I plead. You never mean to, he says quietly. I sit back in my seat and dont say another word for the rest of the drive home. I stay a few feet back while he unlocks our door. I dont want to risk bumping into him if he stops short. As soon as Im through the doorway I make a beeline for the kitchen. I stand with my back to the living room and grip the sink between my fingers, trying to figure out the best way to go about this when hes already upset, but its my fault for leaving it to the last minute. I hear the floorboards creak and turn around in time to realize hes right behind me. I stifle a gasp. . I ask, Do you want me to order something? His grip tightens on my hand. Im not really hungry anymore. I can start to feel sharp pains shooting up through my hand. I refuse to let it show on my face. Why did you have to act like that? We couldve been having a nice, romantic meal right now, but no. You had to go and ruin it, like you do with everything.
I dont know why I do it, and I can predict exactly whats going to happen when I say, I didnt do anything wrong! You were the problem. You freaked out on me for no reason. I lose steam at the end when I see his face. . But then I feel him grab my forearm and yank me back over to him. I know its coming, but I still feel shocked when he slaps me across the face. My cheek burns, and I know there will be a mark tomorrow. I stay there looking down at the floor until he releases my arm. I am not the problem here, he calls over his shoulder. I straighten and turn to watch him walk into our bedroom and slam the door. I will myself not to cry even though I can feel the tears welling up in the corners of my eyes. I inhale and shakily exhale. I woke up this morning swearing I would tell him. I had put it off long enough, and I felt like he deserved to know. It was his, after all. . He would just force me to keep it, and Im not subjecting anyone else to this kind of treatment. I close my eyes for a moment. When I open them again I quietly take off my heels and slip on my sneakers. Then I quickly unbolt the door and sprint for the stairs, without looking back. . ",,real
3,"Unusual words and definitions:
Anole-a green lizard
Setae-small hairs that assist lizards in movement. A green lizard, named Jolie, saw water droplets dripping from the inside of a decaying log located in an unkempt backyard. The spring snow was melting and this caused hunger and excitement to course through the anole, sending her in a fit of circles at the threshold. She slid into the depths of the log, by way of setae on the bottoms of her feet. Speaking to her frog friend, Fritz, through release of a chemical through her scaly skin, she said she was ready to leave their hideout. Because lizards and frogs belong to different species, having very different bodies and mannerisms, Jolie and Fritz communicated uniquely. Yet, friendship afforded the pair understanding of each other. Dread flashed memory of how the pair had barely escaped from being eaten on the day it snowed. The snow saved them, and now they were safe. He didn't want this to change. He croaked in low pitch, and then hopped as high as he could within limited space away from the bad idea. Sunshine was abundant on the day it snowed. The day felt perfect for hunting, so Jolie initiated an outing from their previous home beneath the house belonging to the yard. The two indulged in spring's plentiful present of insects until they were stuffed and sluggish. They were caught off guard when a determined sparrow attacked. During the melt, neither the lizard nor the frog were aware of the log being watched by the sparrow, who had failed to capture Fritz. It still hungered and wanted to satisfy a deliciously deadly craving. . Meanwhile, a young girl in the yard's house noticed the snow melting while seated at a table near a window displaying the yard. Anxiousness to play made her push unwanted lunch about a small plate hoping to be excused from eating. She imagined herself bundled, warmly, outside amidst what was left of the snow. She wanted to run carefreely and blow her bubbles. She noticed a sparrow high up in a tree her father promised to cut as soon as spring took full hold. The bird, though perched silently and still, seemed to be inviting her outside to play with it. Right then, she thought it would be wonderful to share her bubbles with the bird. She decided she would blow some that would sail high up to the top of the tree. She smiled when she imagined the bird's delight. The girl could not see the lizard and frog. . And yet, the three were all part of what took place after the snow began to melt. Jolie followed Fritz to the far end of the log where leaves and dirt created a wall. Her hunger intensified urge to return to hunting. She hissed, then bumped up against him, begging her friend to join her. Fritz, with an inflated voice sac, continued to croak his no. The scratch on his back stung, reminding of when the sparrow had clutched him as dinner. The log and the snow had saved them. He decided he could remain here forever feasting on algae and unfortunate critters that made their way inside. Jolie gave up on trying to convince Fritz it was time for them to return to normal life. She moved towards the light alone clicking anticipation. The sparrow saw her exit beneath the droplets. . ""Hurry and eat your lunch,"" the girl inside the house was encouraged after being seen eyeing the window with great desire. ""You can go out once you finish."" Excitedly, the girl went to work at clearing the plate, stuffing her mouth and almost choking. ""Take your time,"" she was warned. ""The snow will still be there when you finish."" ""But the bird will be gone,"" she thought but kept to herself. Carefully, she chewed the mouthful before picking up a small plastic cup from beside the plate. Jolie scurried out of the hideout, feeling brave in embrace of freedom. Right away, she saw a mound of leaves moving that she hurried over to. The cricket tried to flee without success. Satisfaction enveloped the anole after eating the light snack. . Fritz entertained fear although he was safe inside of the log. He felt torn between wanting to remain where he was and not wanting Jolie to face danger alone. Life without her would be less fulfilling, he decided after remembering their many adventures. He hopped towards the light. The young girl inside of the house had cleared her plate and emptied her cup. She put on a heavy coat and a wool hat before taking a container of bubbles from her room to share with the bird. Now, she was ready to enter the great outdoors. A pine shrub less than a wingspan away from Jolie seemed to the sparrow to be perfect for relocation. It would wait there until she moved beneath it. Then, the sparrow would claim the lizard for itself. Fritz saw the sparrow glide in decent from the top of the tree to the shrub near his friend. . Jolie lifted her head from her search feeling happy to see Fritz, and directly on the heels of happiness she felt fear. Immediately, she turned brown as dirt when she eyed the sparrow. Just as the bird revealed its presence with forceful flap of its wings as it reached sharp talons towards its prey, the girl ran towards it whistling as best she could with a loaded bubble wand in hand. This startled the sparrow, giving a second for Jolie to move out of its grasp. A large rainbow filled bubble left the wand in the direction of the sparrow causing it to ascend awkwardly trying to miss it. More bubbles followed. One burst at the sparrow's retreating feet. The girl giggled as she watched the bird fly away from her returning to the top of the tree. Both, Jolie and Fritz returned to safety inside of the log. Jolie bumped into him in affectionate acknowledgement of his fear. She was happy to be safe within the log again with Fritz, although she was still anxious and hungry. . ",,real

5,"Manny Core, like all men in the village enjoyed a good beer and a good prank. When he got drunk, he was often known to switch around everyone's shoes, replace the wine with vinegar ( classic Manny ) and pretend to be a ghost or some other creature. One day, word spread about town that the duke would be traveling from his castle to the castle of some other duke whose daughter he wished to marry and whose lands he wished to inherit. The duke would be spending a night in the village as the village was in the middle of nowhere and there wasn't really any place else to stop. The village had only one inn which meant that by necessity it was both where the duke was going to stay and where Manny liked to do his drinking. Manny decided to go the scary-creature route, but he would go the extra mile this time. Enlisting his friends to help with his plan, Manny started to prepare for the duke. When the duke arrived, he went straight to the inn to start drinking. After he had had two or three flagons of ale, Manny's friends, who had strategically placed themselves at the next table over and were drunk enough for `` subtle '' to no longer mean anything, began to talk very loudly so that the duke could hear them. `` It sure is a shame about that beast in the woods, '' said one friend who, from his halting delivery, was obviously not an actor. `` Yes, '' said a second. `` It ate all of my sheep. '' `` If only some noble person would come save us, '' said a third. . `` I hear that maidens dig monster-slayers, '' Manny's second friend added. That did it. The duke was in. `` Don't worry peasants, '' the duke said, slurring his words in a way that I am no good at transcribing. `` I shall save you from your beastie. '' Everyone in the inn turned their eyes to him in a mixture of confusion and admiration. Most of them weren't in on Manny's plan, but they weren't going to question a noble when he was making heroic declarations. `` Oh thank you, m'lord, '' said the third friend. `` Finally someone will slay the beast out in the woods. '' `` What sort of monster do you have? '' asked the duke. . `` It shoots poison and eats men whole, '' added the third. `` And Manny Core has huge teeth! '' shouted the second. He was promptly elbowed in the rib to shut him up as huge teeth were not part of the plan, nor was giving out Manny's name. To be fair, manny had quite the over bite. `` What did you just say? '' asked the duke. `` Manicore? '' `` Manticore, '' said the third friend, quickly recovering. `` The beast is called a manticore. '' By this point, the duke was getting a little nervous, but all of the villagers were staring at him and one does not simply back down from an heroic declaration. . The small party had not been there for more than ten seconds before Manny bellowed out the biggest `` rawr '' he could and shambled out of the under growth. Manny had draped himself in a great animal hide lined with fresh fleece. A pair of wings made of linen and sticks were strapped to his back and a rolled up carpet dragged from his bottom. He even had a small sheep bladder filled with the lye his wife used to make soap that he was squirting out ahead of himself. To sober eyes in the full light of day, Manny would have looked ridiculous, but as it was very dark and the duke was very drunk, he was terrified. The duke ran as fast as he could back to the inn where he barricaded himself in his room and left promptly the next morning. . In the years to come, it would become a favorite story of his to tell at parties, becoming grander and grander each time. Back at the village ( which the duke went several days out of his way to avoid on his return trip with his new bride ) Manny and his friends didn't give the incident much thought . ",,real

It wears at your face, abrasive and heat and a long, long journey. You see the sun sink beyond the dunes, orange and dull, and the night is cold. You shiver. Daylight is a distant dream. Heavy weights in your knapsack, and your aching shoulders. Emptiness. Slowly, carefully, the blue is back, but paler now. It's thin and wispy, and it dances across your brow. The blue, the blue - soft as butterflies'wings on your eyelids. Digging into cool sand with your fingers, fine and smooth and satisfying. An hourglass streaming from your lifted hand. Methodical, meditative, polished round stones. Dark blue again, and the night breeze on your neck. Starlight. The curious blue as you rise to your feet, compressing cool sand. You walk, you walk, the journey goes. Blue and cool and air in your lungs. The city emerges from the horizon. . Blue nudges at your elbows. Blue, and the warming breeze. The familiar outline of stones on the path. The smell of baking bread, the scent of roses. Blue, blue...   You are home. You are home. . ",,real
9," I thought you knew what you were doing!    The panic in my voice was clear despite the blaring of alarms that sought to drown it out. Trying to keep my composure, I held the bag now filled to the brim with money with one hand, and tightened my grip on my rifle with the other.  Of course I do! Just keep moving!    Ryan turned and started to rush down another grimy maintenance corridor, his head spinning wildly this way and that looking for any sort of escape route. It had been far too long since we had blown the safe and grabbed the cash - we should have been long gone by now. Instead, we were still stuck here, pushing against locked door after locked door, trapped like rats in a cage.  But     Shut up! Just get off my case for a minute!    Mentioning my family only made me feel worse. They were the only reason that I had got myself into this mess in the first place. Not like I would have taken any other course of action, mind you - they meant everything to me. To see them all dying slowly of that illness, with my wreck of a life and lack of a job making me unable to get the help they needed I would do this all again if I had to. I would just hope that next time it would go more smoothly.  Finally!    Ryan  s excited cry snapped me out of my thoughts. A set of heavy doors had finally swung open in response to his attempts, and there up ahead was another set, the sun peeking through their edges, the glow they created almost beckoning us towards them. .  he shouted, but I did not need telling. Breaking into a run, I darted past him as fast as I could, reached the end of the corridor and pushed upon the door. A brief flicker of joy erupted inside of me as they opened to my touch. It was crushed almost instantly as my eyes took in in everything around me  the dazzling sunlight. The endless rows of police cars and flashing red and blue lights surrounding the building. And the dozens of police officers hidden behind them, guns raised, ready to fire at anything that appeared in their crosshairs. I didn't hear the shots get fired. I only felt the pain, so sudden, so agonisingly painful. The force of the shots sent me spinning to the ground, my head cracking harshly off the concrete, a small puddle of crimson splattering down next to my body. .    Even through the pain I heard that shout, and my vision remained clear. I could see Ryan coming out the door, the mix of terror, grief and confusion etched so perfectly on to his face it looked as though it had been carved there. Then he too was struck by another volley of shots, blood starting to rush from his chest almost instantly. As I watched him also fall to the ground the realisation came to me so clearly, even though my thoughts were fading away  he had never known what he was doing. He was trying to help me and help my family, but not with a grand scheme or any sort of plan, just with his instincts and the desperate hope that everything would turn out ok.   And that was the first of the three lies. The other two merely followed as a consequence - we were never going to get out of here. . Guilt and sadness flooded through my dying body, but I was comforted by the fact I knew I had tried. I had not just let them die. As my vision blurred, I took in Ryan  s body one more time. I held no anger towards him and the lies he had told me  he had only tried to help. The choices I had made were my own, and even though they led to this, at least I had made them. I had tried to make things better. With this in mind, I closed my eyes, and made peace with God. . ",,real

	Its a Tuesday evening, six oclock in East Manhattan, New York at the Penrose bar. I had never had much luck dating so my best friend, Stephanie set me up with a banker, Steven. I walked into the bar in a nice black dress, its my favorite date night dress, long lace sleeves with a low cut. I paired the dress with these shoes I got last month at Bloomingdales, they were having a sale. I told Steven I would meet him at the bar at six oclock but its 6:10pm and no sign of Steven. I was waiting around aimlessly looking like an idiot so I finally walked to the bar and asked for a drink, gin martini, with a twist. Suddenly I saw this guy walk in, he was in a blue blazer paired with a pok-a-dot bow tie and he had nice balck pants and matching shoes. He looks flushed and out of breath. He walked up to me and said, Hi, are you Abigail? I felt my anger rising, its nearly 6:30pm, but I took a deep breath and said, Yes, are you Steven? We went to a table and ordered our food, I was so anxious that I only ordered a salad, he had chicken with vegetables. There was an awkward moment until he asked me what I do for a living, Im an interior designer. After that we started talking about our jobs and the problems that go on at work, we started laughing. . I could tell he was nervous, almost sweaty. He smiled at me and I smiled back I was full of joy, he seemed like the perfect guy for me, kind, a gentle man and very sincere but what are his thoughts on me? The evening was going by perfectly, I stared into her beautiful brown eyes, I could look at them forever, Does she think Im a jerk for being 30 minutes late, I really hope she doesnt she seems perfect for me. We laugh, share war stories, I learn about her life, I could so easily fall in love and marry this girl, shes perfect. I thought to myself, Oh my goodness, is love at first sight a real thing? . I thought to myself, First impressions arent everything, sometimes it's what comes after that first impression that means the most. + Hopefully I get a kiss before the night is over. We continued walking, the lights looked so beautiful and I was mesmerized, I think this date is going really well and I really want to kiss Abigail should I go for it? My heart is racing, she is so beautiful but what if she doesnt feel the same way? Abbigail looked at me with her big brown eyes, she pulled me close and gave me a kiss. I stood there shocked. She made the move. I had to do that before the night ended. Abigail said. My heart stopped, my hands were shaking. . That was the whole point. I looked into his eyes, how can he be so perfect? We continued to walk, just looking at the lights, we could hardly see the stars. It was a foggy night and the lights were shining so bright. This is the perfect night. Its funny, he was 30 minutes late, I thought he was going to be a jerk, I was so wrong. He is perfect. Absolutely perfect. We walked to a bench. He asked, So, this night has been perfect but how can I make it up to you that I was late. I laughed, Well, continue to be a gentleman and all is forgiven. As we sat at the bench, we talked about the realist things, the struggles at work, our childhood, our deepest fears. . The lights start to fade, I checked my watch and it's 2am. Where did the time go? Steven looked at me and said, I dont want this night to end. I laughed, smiled and agreed. We walked for a while, looking at the sky trying to find stars. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and said, How can a jerk like you turn into the perfect gentleman in one night. Steven looked at me, smiled and replied, Well my charm came out, do you like it? We laughed like little kids, the night was something out of a movie. As we walked there was mist on the sidewalk and I slipped, Steven caught my fall. I felt so embarrassed, I dont want him to think Im clumsy, even though I am. . My phone rang, its Stephanie, I declined the call and yet she kept calling, finally I turned my phone off. I wanted to enjoy the time with Steven. We walked to my car, Im sad, I didnt want the night to end but it was nearly 3:30 am and I had to wake up at 7 am to meet a client. We get to her car, shes so beautiful. I almost ruined this date and Im so happy she gave me a second chance. As she opened the car door, my heart sank. I said, Do you have to go? A smile had appeared on her face. She sighed and said, Yes, but I wish I didnt have to. I closed the car door, grabbed her face and kissed her. . I said, I had to do that before the night ended. We looked at each other and I could feel her heartbeat on my chest. Goodnight Abigail, I hope you drive safe. She got in the car, Goodnight Steven, tonight was perfect. As she drove off, I could feel sadness come over my body. I walked to my car, I called my mom, I just met the girl Im going to marry. As Im driving home I called Stephanie, Im going to marry Steven. . ",,real
13,"The sun is shining brightly outside my car window as I wait at a traffic stop. The sky is a clear blue, the weather a perfect warm; an apt temperature for summer plans; family outings  beach, BBQ, picnic, and the likes. For us, in the car, however, it is quite the opposite. The air in the car is sullen and quiet. I try to make the occasional conversation with my Mum on the back seat, but her replies are in monosyllables. My wife Jess; beside me on the passenger seat, sits silently, mostly in thought, making an occasional comment or a random question to Mum. So, even though the world outside our car window is the perfect temperature for fun and frolic, we in the car are solemn and tense, unsure of our destination ahead and how things will unfold. Some days; when Mum is her lucid self, she is much easier to deal with, but those days are now far and few. Today seems like one of those days; with her seemingly calm, composed and subdued, however still timidly retreated into her internal world of disillusionment. Jess, myself and our kids Reese and Luella have given Mum, our love, and support through her most difficult of phases. But as her symptoms worsen, it has inadvertently festered, filling our once cheerful house with anger and resentment. Dementia; although a condition diagnosed to a single individual; in reality affects an entire family, bearing down on the threads of its relationships, unraveling   it at its seams wearing it thin and as a result exhausting and depressing each and every person within it. . A few weeks ago; unknowingly to anyone in the house, Mum wandered out the front door, leaving us with the mental and physical torture of frantically searching the streets close by looking for her. Thankfully, Luella spotted her just in time boarding the town bus and getting her off was an ordeal in itself with Mum being aggressive and non-cooperative. The incident thus sealed the deal to placing her in a care facility; as her doctor had suggested a long time ago. So; here we were, on our way to an extensively researched care facility for Mum. Oblivious to our destination, she sits in the back seat, somber and quiet. My stomach has been hollow since the time I awoke and my heart heavy with an unbearable ache coupled with the feeling of guilt from what I have set out to do. . I cast a glance at Dom to make sure he's okay, he has been pensive and absent-minded all morning, going about the house placing things in places that don't belong. It isn't easy for him, what we do today, but he has finally accepted it as the inevitable solution. They're relationship has never been an easy one; bordering more on hostility, since Dom's Grandmama had essentially raised him, with Stella being an absent mother for most of his growing years. She worked in another state; supporting them  something she never let him forget. Yet, Dom always felt abandoned, feeling she could have done more to keep him closer to her. This difference in opinion brought with it a lot of animosity over the years. But despite their strained relationship, Dom never waivers from his obligation as a son. . So, he mentally struggles with having to see the people he cares for pitted against each other. The kids; although understanding of her, find it difficult to be objective when Mum spews aggressive tirades at their parents when in one of her moods. I, too, feel similar to the kids when she verbally attacks them, but being the adult aware of my husband's predicament, I advise them to be more sympathetic towards her, although most days it is increasingly difficult to justify. My relationship with her as well has always been a very prickly one, with her never approving of Dom's choice for a wife. Yet; at this time in her life, I feel sorry for her. Stella has always been a strong and independent woman; making lemonade with all the lemons that life threw at her. . So now, when she needs the assist, I try to help and make things easier for her where I possibly can. I watched her earlier at breakfast, relishing the meal I made her. She dressed in her favorite; a floral summer dress, one that she usually keeps for special occasions. Smiling and mumbling to herself, she sat eating the meal in front of her, looking content and ready. It was almost as if she was prepared and anticipated what was going to happen. Dom on the other hand feels torn and guilt stricken, wanting to support Stella as a son, yet divided between tending to her and providing a stable and peaceful environment for everyone  including Stella. ***
 
I awoke this morning feeling like my old self again  strong and confident. I saw the packed bags at the corner of the staircase and I knew. . But I have no anger or resentment in my heart for anyone. Dom has given me love and patience to my heart's content, more than I gave to him, more than I deserve. I have always loved him, but in my effort to provide the best to him, I forgot that all the world's love and affection falls short compared to that of a mother's, which unfortunately my Dom never got enough of. Unknowingly and unintentionally sometimes, I give this beautiful family a tremendous amount of grief and heartache. Despite all the things I remember saying and doing, Jess and the kids have nevertheless opened their hearts and patiently accepted all my flaws. I sit silently eating breakfast saying a little prayer for this large hearted family. . As we drive to our destination, I sit silently in the back seat watching the people passing by. Dom takes a turn, and we pass a familiar street and suddenly, I have a recollection and I remember where I was going the other day. ***
 
I am driving deep in thought when suddenly Mum hastily calls out to me as she somehow recognizes the road we are on. It was the road leading to my Grandmama's house; the one I grew up at, where Mum grew up at. She softly requested if we could go there; her pleading eyes speaking a thousand words. So, I agreed and quickly made a U-turn back to the lane. Grandmama was no longer alive, but the house she lived at still stood. It was a shell of a house now, weathered down by years of degrading wood and bricks. . Mum stepped out of the car staring at the structure, her face lit up, and her eyes glistened with tears. She slowly made her way up the steps onto the porch. Jess found the spare key we kept under a rock and quickly let us in. Mum wandered the house in a daze, she had a look of happiness and contentment on her face. She seemed distant, as though she was far away, in a memory. As she came back to the front where we waited, she slowly turned back towards the house again, whispered softly and said ""Bye Mama. Then she slowly turned to face me again, touches my cheek with her palm, smiles and with a sudden emergence of her lost confidence says, Ok Dom, come let's go, I'm ready. And with that, she makes her way to the front door. . Dom turns to smile and wave, I can see him looking torn, so I smile a smile that emits what I truly feel. A sense of satisfaction, contentment and pure happiness. Dom took me home to meet Mama one last time. I made peace with the demons that lived in me all these years. I'll come to see you soon Mum, I promise. were Dom's last words to me. I knew he would, just like I knew that things would now be okay for all of us. . ",,real

15,"Its just a 6-hour train ride, I kept thinking, with only the cool comfort of the window seat in the train to soothe the rising frustration, but the compromise of the train ride was disrupted by the rude awakening of a shrill cry from a child, loud - overlapping voices of the many passengers, and the tightly spaced terminal car. How could I even think of taking a train tour?, I wondered to myself. It was a sunny afternoon in the summer of Tokyo, and the ideal break was to take a train ride and bypass refreshing scenes of nature, yet chaos within the train was what was delivered. Stampedes of Why did I decide to do this? I shouldve stayed home. Well, I did come here for a train ride, I might as well enjoy it, I thought, but the voices in the car left little room to be satisfied. Suddenly there was a crackle from the intercom above. Passengers, the captain spoke, we will be departing from Tokyo and traveling to Nagano, Nagano Prefecture and departing back, please let yourself be in our care and enjoy riding the Mitzuko Express. As soon as the short notification ended, the train became quiet, which left the cries of a baby to fill the void of silence. Now, hopeless for peace and quiet, I opted for the scenery outside, though there were only the busy streets and the skyscraper buildings of Tokyo. Eventually every 40-minute, stops were provided, snacks were distributed and the trip continued on. . Uh, Miss Adachi Shi-zu-zaki? I apologize, but could you please move your bags a little, so I can fit my bags in the overhead compartment. Excuse me? Uh, could you move your bags, please? Excuse me! Hello! Someone was waving their arms over my head. Huh? A wavy silhouette of a man stood before me. Did I doze off? I thought to myself, Well whatever, I shrugged. Hey!, the silhouette said. Can you come and move your bags? I squinted my eyes. I looked around and then pointed to myself like the 24-year-old idiot I was. . Yes, now can you please move your bags? He said, politely. After getting out of my seat, I carefully maneuvered around the crowded area moving towards the overhead compartment. As soon as we became situated with our baggage, the unknown man flopped right down in the empty seat right next to me! What are you doing? I asked. What do you mean, this is my seat? He said and quickly shuffled out his train ticket, 2B, it read. My seat was 2A. Welp, theres nothing I can do about this, might as well deal with it, I thought, as I tried to come to a compromise with myself, though like the socially awkward adult I was, sitting next to anyone for that matter, was a difficult task. . Why does it have to be today, was my luck crushed by the evil gods of hell? I wondered. With more odd faces of discomfort it may have come to the mans attention that to sense the awkwardness, in all grace, the man offered to introduce himself. Hey. Um, sorry for the trouble I caused you earlier, my name is Yutoda, Toda Saitama. Once I relayed the short introduction through my mind, together, we went down the long rabbit hole of discovering more about each other. From embarrassing childhood memories to the recent years of university, we slowly became acquaintances or friends. For a moment, even the loudest of screams or the stench body odor from the over-crowded space no longer came into existence, it was just the light-hearted laughter from Yutoda and me. . Definitely. He answered back. Right, so, whens your birthday? I started. January 23, 1993. He answered confidently. Whens yours? He asked right back. December 23, 1994, I said. Time flew by as if it were a bullet train speeding through the night with only the night to catch up and before we knew it, the train was approaching Nagano, Nagano Prefecture. For a second, we stopped talking, and soon all of the passengers became silent, silent to stare at the nature in awe. From outside the glass window, lay the deep green, crisp pastures of Nagano. Near that was the sloshing, white, clear water stream that provided the grass its color. . Soon after though, the laughter and talk were up and running around the train, but the vivid images of the green forests and the bright suns reflection against the clear, cool water of the stream were permanent. Then, the tour took a rest at the 3 hour stop in Nagano, Nagano Prefecture, preparing for the departure back. It was announced by the captain that the passengers could walk around the perimeter of the train, viewing the outside nature. Wanna go? I asked Yutoda. Absolutely, Adachi, why wouldnt I want to go! He replied. Together we stepped off of the train and wandered through the lush, green grass and breezy winds around the train. Around us were magnificent, butterflies varying in shapes and sizes, the fresh air of the countryside, and the calm squawking of birds. . Going back to Tokyo was easier than the departure from Tokyo, with more hushed voices, fewer worries, and more laughter. Though sleep was slowly taking over my mind, after having to deal with the noise and for staying awake for 4 hours, a nap sounded nice, but right before sleep overtook my body, I caught one last glimpse of the calm, serene nature, and drifted off to sleep on Yutodas shoulder, ready to go back to Tokyo. .

The interior garage door opened with a loud creak as it swung open. The car was parked in the middle of the driveway and there was no sign of anyone inside. Where are we going? I asked my husband. He didnt answer for what seemed like five minutes before he said, We need to get out of here. Its getting dark.
	I followed him into the garage and turned on the lights. We walked down the gravel path until we reached the end of the road. There were several houses that lined the side of the street but none stood out from the rest. s interior garage door opened, and Lottie scooted out of the car into the driveway. Lottie! What are you doing?
	Im trying to get away from mommy, said LottIE as she hopped happily across the lawn toward the house. I watched her for what seemed like five minutes before turning my attention back to the road. She was still scooting along at a fairly good distance, so I decided to give it a try. After three shaky attempts, I finally managed to pull myself up onto the front seat of the minnie mouse sofa chair in the living room. As I sat down, I noticed that one of the spindle backed seats on the sofa had been replaced by a dark brown leather L-shaped chair. . I, and the minnie mouse sofa chair. I turned to see Lottie scooting her way along the carpeted floor of the garage. What are you doing? I asked. She looked up at me with a look that said, Its time for us to go!
 
The interior garage door opened just as we were about to leave. We both jumped out of the car and ran down the driveway towards the house. As soon as we reached the front door, our hands held tight to each other in anticipation of what was going to happen next. After what seemed like five minutes or so, my eyes adjusted to the dim light coming through the sliding glass doors on the far side of the room. The first thing I noticed was how small the house was compared to the rest of the neighborhood. . 
 
The interior garage door opened and Lottie jumped out onto the driveway, hopping happily across the gravel. Lets go play in the mud! she said as she ran into the house. I followed her with my hands holding tight to the steering wheel. We walked for what seemed like five minutes until we reached a small clearing on the side of the road. There was a large pile of dirt at the edge of the clearing that had been left there by someone who hadnt bothered to clean it up when they got home. As we entered the clearing, our eyes were drawn to a notch heading toward the east end of the property. It was about two feet away from where we were standing now. Our legs were still scooting along the ground, trying to find their way back to us. . s palm luckily making solid contact with Lottie. Lottie, are you okay?
	Im fine, mommy, said LottIE as she scooted along the floor of the garage. I followed her down the hallway and into the dining room. It was a dark brown leather L-shaped chair that had two spindle backed seats on either side. There were four other chairs in the room but they were all occupied by children or adults. The closest dining room chair to me was the Minnie Mouse sofa chair which had been sitting there for what seemed like five minutes. After three shaky attempts at getting up from my precariously perched position, I finally managed to get myself out of the chair and onto the ground. . s notch heading toward the next dining room chair. Lottie! Lottie, come here! I called out to her as she hopped happily across the floor and up into the closest dining room seat. She didnt move for what seemed like five minutes until she was still scooting along at a fairly good distance from where I was sitting. At that point, I had no choice but to sit down in my dark brown leather L-shaped chair with its two spindle backed seats. . I, and the last dining room chair. Lottie! I called out to her. She was still scooting along the floor of the living room, but now she was looking up at me with a wide smile on her face. Her tail wagged as she hopped happily across the carpeting in front of us. The interior garage door opened and Lottie bounded out into the driveway. We all looked at each other for what seemed like five minutes before we turned our attention back to the situation at hand. There was no sign of any movement from either side of the house. A few seconds later, there was a notch heading toward the kitchen. . I!

17,"10 years earlierIn a deep dark jungle, a team of 5 scientists discovered a weird object and when touched causes grave danger. This object glowed bright blue and was in a starlike shape. They discovered the object when they were doing a secret investigation at Mount Linai. Bob, one of the scientists, touched the object. All of a sudden, there was a loud boom and all five scientists were zapped from existence, never to be seen from or heard again. Hello and welcome to City News, Im your anchor Martin Lin and I have breaking news. Last night, a team of 5 scientists disappeared out of nowhere. We are searching near Mount Linai where they were last seen. Lets go to our eyewitness John Kandinsky for details.Hey Martin, exclaimed John. Her mom hopped into the car and drove her to the ceremony.You know I wish dad were here, said Bella. I know you do honey, replied her mom. But, I know if he were here hed be really happy for you. That car accident was so scary, Im lucky to be alive. Smiling, Bella climbed out of the car and ran to her group of 4 friends. Bella was the funny one, she was always trying to make her friends laugh. Meghan was the serious one and very smart. Alex was the sporty guy and was good at almost every sport. Brady was the artsy one. He was good at creating inventions. Guys I cant believe were graduating, shouted Bella. . I cant wait for high school. I just hope I got enough high school credits, exclaimed Meghan. Same, said Brady.Guys after school come to my house, said Bella. Sure, they all replied. After promotion, all four friends headed to Bellas house to celebrate. They turned on the tv and then something caught Meghans eye. Hello and welcome to city news. Im your host Martin Lin. Today I have breaking news! It was been exactly 10 years since Bob Marsh.Meghan paused the tv and shouted, Isnt Bob Marsh your dads name Bella. No, replied Bella. . Uh Bella I think thats your dadWait a minute why does it say he and 4 friends went missing at Mount Linai? Asked Bella. Well this incident happened ten years ago,replied Meghan. Wait but hasnt Bella always said he died in a car accident, said Brady. So you guys are saying my mom has been lying to me this whole time? questioned Bella. Her friends nodded their heads and walked out the door. In the evening at dinner Bella brought up her dad. Mom how did dad die? asked Bella. Honey Ive already told you he died in a car crash, she answered. . I just didnt want to tell you because I didnt want to scare you. Here let me show you something that your father had found. This was on the ground and they gave it to me.Her mother carefully opened a small box and revealed a bright blue star like object. Bellas mouth was wide open. She took the object and placed it above her nightstand. That night, as Bella was touching the bright blue object, the blue light went out and there was a loud boom and Bella was gone. Bella time for breakfast, her mother shouted. There was no answer. So she called for Bella again. Wondering what was wrong her mother walked up the stairs. To her surprise Bella wasnt there. . Maybe she ran away because I lied to her, she thought. Ding dong, the doorbell rang. Bellas mom opened the door and saw three smiling faces. Good morning miss, said Alex. Whats wrong? asked Meghan. Well I cant find Bella anywhere. I searched the whole house. Do you want us to help you find her? Brady asked. Ms Marsh nodded at the three kids as she ushered them inside. The kids went up the stairs to Bellas room and began to search. Bella awoke and was in complete darkness. She couldnt see anything and had no idea where she was. . Who are you? said a deep gruff voice. Im Bella Marsh. Wait a minute, you're my dad!The man nodded and told Bella it had been 10 years. Were trying to find a way out but Im starting to give up.Guys where do you think she went, exclaimed Brady. He was looking at things on Bellas desk. Then, he saw a blue star like shaped objects. Brady grabbed it and then, there was a loud boom and he was zapped from existence. OMG where did he just go?said Alex. Uh I have no idea, yelled Meghan. . Wait a minute. Dont you remember what it said on the news? No, answered Meghan. Why dont we rewatch it.Dad, how come you look the same? asked Bella. Well here every year is a minute. Wait, so you're saying I have been here for 2 years?YesAll of sudden there was a loud thud. What was that, yelled Bob. He shined the light on Brady. Who are you, Bob yelled. Im Bellas friend. Bella ran over to him and hugged him. Hello and welcome to City News! . I think if we destroy it we save the people inside, exclaimed Meghan. They must be trapped inside. How do you know all this? asked Alex. Oh Ive read tons of fanfiction, screamed Meghan. She got a baseball bat from Alexs house. She gave it to him and he gave it his best whack. The tiny pieces shattered everywhere. I dont see anything, said Alex. Meghan grabbed a magnifying glass and looked at the particles. OMG I see 7 people and two of them are Bella and Brady. Except they're all tiny. Let me see, said Alex. . They were Alex and Meghan. Uh guys why are we so small? she asked. Im afraid well have to stay like this, her father said. Until someone finds a way. . ",,real

Its been a month tomorrow since I last saw Hadassah. She never shows anything different from the day she left me. Her eyes are still as bright as they were when we first met and her hair is just as long as it ever was. Did you brush your hair today miss.
	My steady fingers go over the many dirty towels on the floor. The fluffy mustard yellow sponge floats in the air above my head. My mind wanders back to that night. We spent the night away without any worries or regrets. It had been such a wonderful time for both of us. But now here I am at home with no one to talk to. No one to help me get out of this place called safety. Ive told Jeanne multiple times that I dont want to be here, but she never shows anything different. She is always smiling and laughing at my jokes. Its been a month tomorrow since you last saw me, Hadassah, Jeanne says as her strong nails rake the back of my neck. Her eyes sparkle with excitement when she tells me this. My heart races in my chest as I think about how lucky I am to have such a beautiful woman who loves me so much. The thought of being able to spend the night away without having to worry about anyone else makes me smile even more. It has been a long time since I had someone to talk to other than myself. There are only two people I can talk to anymore. . I dont know why, but I feel safe here. This is a place called safety and it seems to be the only one for me right now. The occasional wall stays standing undeterred by my wobbly ankle beneath the fleece green sheets. My mind wanders back to when I first met Hadassah. It had been almost a month tomorrow since she moved out of her parents house. She was so happy to finally have something to look forward to other than sleeping all night away without having to worry about anything else. We were inseparable during our stay in New York. Her name though somehow has lost its charm over the last few months. Hadassah, Jeanne says as she walks up to me. . I, and the occasional wall stays standing undeterred. Ive told Jeanne multiple times that there is a place called Safety where no one can hurt you. But she never shows anything different. Where are ya?
	Please, I beg as I try to get my wobbly ankle beneath me. Her steady fingers go into my hair and her strong nails rake through my scalp. She doesnt seem to mind though somehow it makes me feel more safe. A fluffy mustard yellow sponge floats in front of me on the bedside table. The tiny yellow flowers speckle the white paper. My eyes drift back to Hadassah. It has been a month tomorrow since we last saw each other. .  is a beautiful red ribbon tied with tiny yellow flowers speckle the edges. I think I need to cut my hair today miss.
 
My steady fingers go up to her face and she smiles at me, Its been a month tomorrow since we last saw each other. We havent seen each other in weeks. How are you feeling? Her strong nails rake through my hair as she says this. My mind wanders back to when we first met. It was so long ago that I had forgotten what it felt like to have someone hold your hand. She never shows anything different than how she does now though. The only difference between then and now is that she has grown into a woman who can look after herself. . s steady fingers go to her hair and pull the beautiful red ribbon tied at the top of her head. I like your hair today miss.
 
My mind wanders back to when I first met Hadassah. It had been a month tomorrow since our last meeting, but she still hasnt told me where she lives. She never shows anything different from what I have seen in the past few weeks. Her eyes are always closed as if she is trying to sleep away the night away without having to open them. When we first met, she said that she lived in a place called Safety, which was supposed to be safe for anyone who came into contact with it. However, there were so many people here that no one knew how to get out of safety. . I.
	Its been a month since I last saw you, Hadassah, Jeanne says as her strong nails rake through my hair once more. How are ya?
	She never shows anything different from the first time she met me. Her eyes are always bright and full of life. My mind wanders back to that night at the beach. We were so young then; we had no idea what it would be like to live in this place called safety. It was amazing how fast our lives changed when we finally found out where we were going. . I need to go, I say. What are you going to do?
 
We can talk about it later, Hadassah! She says as she grabs my hand and leads me out of the room. Her strong nails rake through my skin as we walk down the hall towards the kitchen. Its been a month tomorrow since our last conversation but she never shows anything different from her usual self. We make our way into the kitchen where three familiar faces stand at the table with glasses of fizzy champagne filled with sparkling water in front of them. They all have their arms around each other while they sip on their drinks. One of them has a beautiful red ribbon tied over his head that is adorned with tiny yellow flowers speckle the edges. He looks up at me when he sees me and smiles. . I.
 
She looks at me for a moment and then says, You know what? I dont want to be in this place anymore. Its not safe. You need to get out of here. There is a place called Safety where you can stay as long as you like. And if you do it right, there will be no one to take care of you until you come back home. If you do something wrong, the police will find you and put you in jail. Thatll be the end of your life. Do you understand that? She takes my hand and leads me down the hall. As we walk, she tells me how much she loves her job. How many dirty towels she has washed over the past few days. . I cant believe it, she says. Its been a month tomorrow since I last saw you!
How long have you been here? I ask her. She shakes her head and looks at the clock again. It reads 3:30 in the morning. Her eyes dart to the window where three familiar faces stand with their hands clasped behind their backs. One of them is wearing a black t-shirt with a beautiful red ribbon tied up around his neck. The other two are dressed in dark suits that look like they were made by someone who knows what they are doing. They all seem to be talking about something but I can't make out anything. My mind wanders back to when we first met. . ",,fake
19,"It just didn't make sense. The scenes of a bombing run creating fantastic flashes of light against the green night vision display used in the recorded video the media kept on repeat, to show the campaign which they cease to talk about. The flashing of the television lighting and darkening the room with each bomb exploding. There is talk of escalation. Raul turns off the T.V. He leaves the living room for the bed room and pushes open the door into the dark. Only the flashing of an alarm clock can be seen blinking '11:03 P.M. ''   Crawling into bed, he lays his head upon the pillow. drifting into sleep after thinking about everything he possibly could. He beings to dream...   *BOOM*   He is awoken in a startle. The room being still dark with only the alarm clock flashing '1:25 AM '. He felt what seemed like a drifting rumble, but that was nothing to indicate an explosion ; everything seemed to drift back into quite. Couldn't have been an earth quake, not out here on 90, not out here outside Rapid City, North Dakota. He thought for a while more. Confused as ever, he walked out into the living room and flipped on the television. Still more talking heads going on about escalations in this proxy war, but nothing about a local 'boom '. Satisfied with an explanation of hallucinating and simply being delusional from work stress, Raul shuffles back to bed. Leaving the T.V. on, in case any emergency signals come through to wake him or provide explanation. He drifts to sleep and begins to dream. . The light of day filling the room, but no echoic scream of an emergency broadcast could be heard. Just a faint rumble in the ears, almost imperceptible - like airliner flying over lower than usual. The T.V. is off. `` What the hell '', said as if annoyed by the phenomena. `` I thought I left that on '', turning his head toward the alarm clock. The faint rumble now becoming louder and the light of day slightly dimmer. '3:38 AM'  `` What the hell is going on '', said now with concern. The roar of a freight train now coming closer, consuming the audible space and Raul's own ability to think. The light of day now burning brighter through the windows and with a faintly colored hue of shifting orange. . As he reaches for the curtain to see outside, to see what ever could be so loud and bright at three in the morning, he is ripped into by the burst of exploding glass. His body barely hitting the floor, his face hardly able to cope with a gesture of surprise, he is consumed in nuclear flame. . ",,real

She 'd been cheating on me for years now. The first time we met it was in high school. We were so young and innocent. He had just gotten out of college with a degree in Criminal Justice. His parents had passed away before he could finish his degree. My heart ached at the thought of him being hurt by someone who cared about him as much as I did. No matter how many times I tried to comfort him, no matter how hard I tried, there was never any answer. There was only silence. ",,fake
21,"It was a bloody awesome scene. Every creative writer in the world had heard of it, but no one really put two and two together. It's something that happens when different canons collide with each other ; you face two mirrors towards each other at the same time, their collision trajectory viewable to anyone within a small radius around them. The realists quickly lost ground to the cosmics, who could summon forth fantastic creatures out of thin air. Their particular canons could form gestalts so large that entire cities could congregate together, or they could be able to create 1-mile delusion fields for people to live in. They didn't have to cleanly integrate like we do now, as there were mutual exclusive clauses between our functional magic paradigms. TheOf course, it wasn't until the early 2000's that reports started coming in of people who could summon forth fantastic creatures from a small radius around them. The realists quickly lost ground to the Ocs and soon they were all talking strange languages as if their particular canons could form gestalts or energy explosions throughout the entire world. Eventually the OCS became mercenaries for the REALISTS so that entire cities could congregate together under one roof. This is where we cross Final Fantasy with Realism. In this novel, two different canons collide at the end of an infintitely long hallway. They both face two mirrors towards each other which make the collision trajectory viewable on either side of the hall. . They, and the new academic field of  Magic Theory.

Reports started coming in about people who had been shot by their own canons as they were trying to cross Final Fantasy into Realism. It was then that the OCS became mercenaries for the REALISTS.

22,"My father-in-law lives with us now. He was diagnosed with cancer and had become very weak and frail. He didnt feel safe living alone anymore, so we brought him to Texas to live with us. He sits in his room all day, saying that he is too tired to get up or that he is too weak to do things for himself. So, I cook for him every day, my wife bathes him, we take him to all of his doctors appointments and wait on him hand and foot. I had a gut feeling that he just wants to be taken care of. I believe that he can do things for himself, but he wants a woman to wait on him hand and foot, and since there are two women in our house, hes hit the jackpot! As time passed, I noticed that my father-in-law was gaining weight, and started looking healthier. (Because I am cooking three meals a day for him!) I knew he was getting better, but he still kept saying he did not have any strength and could not do anything for himself, and he would stay in his bedroom. (It could also be because he never expected his daughter to be a lesbian, and he had not accepted that she was married to me yet. But oh well!) I kept telling my wife to encourage him to wash his clothes, bathe himself, clean his room, but when she would mention it to him, he'd always say that he was too weak and he just didn't have the strength. There were days he would say he could barely stand. I knew he was playing possum, but I didn't know how to prove it. . Oh my God, it was a great! My daughter Taylor Paige went into the garage to take out the trash, right? So... She comes RUNNING into the house yelling ""Mommy!!!! There's a snake in the garage!!!!"" I jump up instinctively to protect my baby.. And then...... I.......... stop... ""A.. Snake?"" Um...... Ok..... So........... I'm standing there, thinking, right? My mind is spinning!!!! I put on some sweatpants, my boots, my big coat and grab my umbrella because now I have to go stand in the rain outside and look INTO the garage from the driveway because I AM NOT walking into the garage from the inside of the house.. The snake might slither into the house, and then what the heck would we do!? . I turned to look at her and asked, What are you doing?? She says, Im going with you, but Im scared.
Jesus.. I stop, turn around and run in the bathroom to tell my wife, who is currently in the shower that there is a snake in the garage! Babe! Taylor saw a snake in the garage!
 
She slowly wipes steam from the shower door, and looks at me through the spot she just wiped clean with BIG EYES, ""A snake???"" By now I am jumping up and down, coughing and about to cry!!! Yes! A snake! She says, ""Tell Dad"". So, I run to Dad's bedroom, Taylor is close behind me, ""Dad! There's a snake in the garage!"" . Almost skipping! I was like looking at him like, Huh? But, ok.
 
Dad goes into the garage from inside of the house. Taylor and I go outside from thefrontdoor and walk around to the garage. We both stand in the driveway freaking out as we watch Dad move like a Cougar through the garage looking for the snake! Dad puts his cane down and starts slinging boxes, big packs of tissue and paper towels, cat litter, cat food, dog food around in the garage like he is NOT 83 years old with stage four Metastatic cancer looking for that darn snake!!! I yelled from the driveway outside of the garage, ""Dad! You're not scared?"" He laughed and said,""It's just a snake."" I was thinking, What? . Now, here comes wife, peeking through the garage door! I tell her to come on out. She creeps out and starts asking us questions, ""What does it look like? How big is it?"" Heck I don't know! Taylor ran so fast from it she didn't have much information about how it looks except it was curled up, opened its mouth at her and slithered away.
 
Dad asks my wife to take the handle of the rake and shoves it through the shelves we have in the garage. She tells him to wait so she can change her shoes in case she needs to run. If that snake moves, we are all running! Dad tells her to just stick the rake in between the shelves, and then.. All of a sudden, he says, ""THERE IT IS!!!"" . My wife is jumping around and trying to run back into the house. Dad starts stomping the damn snake with his old man shoes. Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! He has his foot on the darn snake and is looking at us all like we are nuts! (Bunch of damn girls I am sure he's thinking.) He grabs the shovel, chops the snakes head off, takes a napkin out of his pocket and picks it up. (Why do old people always have tissue in their pockets?) Taylor yells, It's still squirming!!! We are squeezing each other even tighter now! Dad shakes his head. He asks for a bag, I'm yelling at ay my wife, ""Give him the bag over there!!!"" . My other daughter is upstairs looking down at us in the driveway through her bedroom window, and she is jumping up and down too. I was looking up at her thinking, What the hell are you jumping and screaming for? Youre in the house!
 
My wife hands him a bag, and I tell Taylor to get it and put it in the garbage outside. Taylor cries ""Why me??"" My wife yells ""NO! We need to double bag it!"" As if the headless snake may escape and slither back into our garage. (Insert eye roll here)
 
So she double bags the headless snake. I slowly give it to Taylor who takes it out to the street and puts it in the garbage. . I needed a drink, and I dont drink! As we walked back into the house, my wife says, So, he cant walk. Cant bathe himself. Cant clean his room. Cant doanythingfor himself, huh? You were right!
 
I laughed, winked at her and said, If he wasnt here, wed never be able to go into our garage again! So, Ill take it. Dad saved us, so it was only right that we saved him too. Dad was more active from then on, and we continued to wait on him hand and foot. . ",,real
23,"To Whoever Finds This Letter,
 
Hello from Death. Or the Beyond. Or the Great Beyond. Whatever or Whomever you choose to believe in. I am not entirely sure Im dead, but being alive would be a long-shot, since I am about to trek out into the snow after spending four long hours trapped in this bank. What, you may ask, were you doing trapped in a bank while the largest blizzard since the Tuscaloosa Torpedo sent frozen frogs and snowflakes flying around back in 1987? But, being the four-time Teller of the Week that I am, I threw on my snow boots and raccoon-fur earmuffs and drove my 2011 Nissan Murano to the bank. A drive that would normally have taken six minutes and forty-three seconds took a whopping nine and a half minutes, and that was with me hitting nothing but green lights. Once I got there, I was startled to find that I would be the only one holding down the fort since all the other employees had refused to come in, a sentiment shared by our loyal customers, who all stayed home as well. After an hour, it was evident that I would be the only person at DiRonza & Fratzi Community Bank that day, and when I called Mr. DiRonza to ask if I could leave, all my messages went straight to voicemail. . There were no cars on the road, not even so much as a plow, and I knew that I would be trapped inside the bank for some time. Thankfully, I keep my desk stocked with as many healthy snacks as I am allowed, but when my nerves kick in, so does my peckishness, and I soon found that I had eaten all twenty-six of my Newmans Own Raspberry Granola Bars. Despite having a firm understanding of boundaries, my hunger drove me in the dead of that first, long, dark night, to rummage through every desk and wastebasket belonging to my co-workers, who I hope will forgive me should the details of my despair even reach them. . I know, I know. Who am I--Mussolini? Pol Pot? Thomas Crowne? All employees are expressly forbidden from being in the managers office when he or she is not present, but on the off chance that Mr. DiRonza had even so much as a half-chewed papaya in there, I felt it was worth it to break protocol. That brings me to the reason for my writing this letter, because while I would love to assure you that I would have taken pen to toilet paper regardless of the outcome of my illegal expedition, the fact is that its only my alarm at what I found there that leads me to this documentation. . (The Soap Had No Smell to It and Thats How I Knew It Was Some Kind of Gag Item)
 
In the Bottom Left Drawer of His Desk
 

Four Different Copies of The Secret (New Condition)
One Copy of The Lord of the Flies (Terrible Condition)

 
And on the Right Side of His Desk--
 
Ping Pong Balls (Hundreds of Them)
 
Im aware that youre probably very disturbed by now, theoretical reader, and believe me, I was as well. Had I not been convinced of my solitary confinement within the bank, I would have picked up the largest stapler I could find to protect myself against whatever evil creature might be summoned from the various objects I uncovered. . While I was not convinced after the first two drawers, any person who can set utter trash like The Lord of the Flies next to the godsend that is The Secret must be thoroughly unbalanced, and should seek psychiatric help immediately. Although I would normally be happy to participate in whatever intervention is required for Mr. DiRonza, I am, as I stated, most likely dead at this point, having keeled over in a snowbank, unable to be located until Spring. I wish whomever is reading this luck as they decide how best to terminate Mr. DiRonza from his post, and how to alert his father, Andreas DiRonza, co-owner and founder of the bank, as Im sure hell be equally eager to remove his son from the post he gave to him as soon as he was out of college. . Best of luck to everyone at DiRonza and Fratzi Community Bank. I will miss them all, even Mr. DiRonza, though theres a good chance that hes into human sacrifice or ping pong (Im not sure which would be worse). Into the storm I go, and please let my manager know that all I took with me into the fracas was one of his copies of The Secret.
 
Im just thankful he had one to spare. Sincerely
Deborah Ellen Witt-Meyer

25,"The power was out. I groaned and slammed my phone into the couch I had been lounging on. It was summer and everyone blasting their ACs probably caused a power outage. I got up from the purple velvet couch and walked out of the living room. Dad! Can you call the power company! I yelled into what seemed like an empty house. My words echoed off the walls. The eerie silence sent a tingle through my back. Im doing it right now! Go check the electrical box first. My dad replied. Also yelling. My dad had always said a man had to learn to take proper care of the house. You know. Manly stuff. I never had an interest in building things or sports. My dad always thought of it as a weakness. I like video games and art. I dont want to nail things together in the garage. Nonetheless, I was taught. I grabbed a flashlight from the drawer in the kitchen. It was still light out but the basement and electrical room were pitch black. I walked down the wooden stairs into the basement. It was a nice basement. It was furnished and well decorated. But something felt off. I could explain it. I told myself I was being crazy. I probably was. I went about my business and went into the electrical room. I turned on my flashlight with a little click. I shined my light on the gray wooden box in the corner. I gasped. The buttons had been scrapped out. I ran my fingers along the cut metal. What is this? . I screamed and turned around to shine my light at it with one quick swoop. My dad stood there laughing. I frowned. I'm surrounded by idiots. I thought. Can you not?! Its not funny. I said in an agitated tone. Lighten up. He said patting my back. Well more like slamming all the air out of my lungs. He examined the board and frowned. Isnt it weird the buttons are missing like someone clawed it out?! I practically screamed. What do you mean? Quit joking around it is just a short circuit. He said in his usual disappointed tone. That's when I looked over and it was as if the buttons were never gone. . I scratched my head in confusion. Am I losing my mind? I thought I taught you better than that. Oh well. I dont have the parts to fix it today. I will have to go tomorrow, your sister has the car.
	I sighed. I was not looking forward to staying at home with this group of nut jobs. And especially now that our air conditioning didnt work. Hey you know what. Lets go get your mom and have a camping night! He said in an enthusiastic tone. I nodded. That was at least better than staying inside tonight. I sprinted up the stairs toward my moms room. When I knocked on the door she didnt answer. I almost thought she wasnt there. . Come in! She said. When I came in she was sifting through her closet with clothes all over the floor. This was unusual for her. She was always a neat freak. What are you doing? I asked
	She turned around and smiled at me. The smile calmed me. It sent happy waves down my spine. Oh just looking for my flashlight honey. She said in her usual voice. Okay, dad says to tell you he was thinking about having a camping night in the backyard!
	Oh! That sounds great! Ill make us lunches and start packing.
	Okay mom. . We actually had a nice set up. We had our firepit tents and picnic table. It was starting to get dark out so we sprayed ourselves with bug spray and started to cover up. Mom and dad went in their tent to grab some food. So I sat on my chair and looked out at the house. I couldnt explain it but this whole day after the power went out I felt watched. It was a chilling feeling. I hated it. I looked over at the house. I was probably just fooling myself. Dad always said I have an overactive imagination. Wait. No. A figure stood in the window. It caught my eye. The second I saw it my blood ran cold. I rubbed my eyes as hard as I could but it didnt go away. . It was pitch black now which didnt help to relieve my stress. The figure turned from a shadow to a long droopy balck mass. It had a large gaping mouth with several rows of gapping teeth. A long tongue licked the clear and pristine glass. I turned around to alert my parents. They were feet away from me. Just standing there. Guys?!!!! I said in a trembling voice. My parents looked at me. Dead in the eyes. Their eyes were almost blank. Nothing there. Just cold, darkness, and fear. The people I loved. We're gone. Thats the second I knew it. Just like the figure in the window. They morphed. . I fell out of my chair. Every muscle in my body vibrates with alarm. I reach for something. Anything. A thought radiates in my head. It is almost primal. RUN. I get myself up and run through my yard. My Converse slap against the damp lawn. My heart is beating out of my chest. I have to get out of here. I think. But where is that? Suddenly a bright light blinds me. I try to make out where it is coming from. The driveway. My sister. OH NO MY SISTER. I ran as fast as I could to the driveway on the other side of my house. I stood in the headlights with a look of sheer terror. Without thinking I climbed into the passenger seat. . ! I screamed at the top of my lungs. My sister looked at me, startled. She hesitated unsure of what to do. But she saw the look on my face and knew it was urgent. What about mom and dad? She said. Its not them! I swear they are going to kill us! I yelled. She put her key in but before she could start the car she looked forward. I have never seen here so terrified. Because there it is in the headlights. Looking right at us. There was no use now. We are already dead. . ",,real

I was beaten by my mom for not saluting the Large Donut in The Sky, I won a grand prize to see a cockfight in Antarctica, and other nonsensical dreams. Since five years ago, whenever I woke up while holding something in my dreamworld, I am also holding it in reality. I once dreamed of having a cake for my birthday, and I enjoy red velvet cake that. I once dreamed about getting a ticket, and to my surprise, I have to pay the ticket, because I supposedly ram a traffic light and a car dangling by the power lines. It is odd why I decided to pay, maybe because I hate facing the court, as a victim or as a criminal. And to my horror, it is also true today. `` Die, Maisarah! I shouted as we exchange fists high on the stratosphere. `` You have no idea what your actions will bring you, Husain! You will destroy us all!

It still beats in my hand, a small bit of nerves pushing the muscles to do its job when it is uselessly disconnected from my wife's body. I don't know what to do, but one. I must face the law.

33,"Coming to Nand K'tara always felt like coming home to Rhinn.The floating market or the free market (depending on who translated the Gorachi word into Galactic Basic) was a large generation space ship comprised of a hodgepodge of different races from all over the galaxy, outcasts and possibly outlaws, dreamers, wanderers, all with the common desire to explore the universe and pay their way to do so by plying their trade.She stood in the centre of the market, drinking in the bustle with her senses. Alien tongues mingled together like spices in an exotic curry, earthy, sharp and sweet tones, layers of flavour for the auditory nerve. There were words in Gorachi and Baltic, Vajoran, Sumien, Basic, Earth English, Colony Creole, Hindi, Chinese, and a dozen others that she had never heard before. Easy to miss, if one did not know what to look for. A subtle shift in the angle of fur or feather-like projections for some species or a change in colour of skin or eyes or anorgan that had no human equivalent. And then of course some used smell. Rhinn wrinkled her nose, remembering a particularly unpleasant encounter with a few Voryacks engaged in a mating ritual. ""Voryack samboka! Guaranteed to spice up the love life,"" a vendor said, practically assaulting her with a vial of the alien pheromone. No wonder she had summoned the memory. ""No,"" Rhinn said, making a wide berth around the vendor to escape, and jostling a few market-goers who responded with curses in Gorachi and Baltic. Yes, just like home. . Her stomach growled, but she ignored it. Business first. She stopped by a few stalls, browsing the wares nonchalantly. There were starpods, flowers that emitted pale blue light and a low humming sound. Sumiens hung these over babies' cradles for luck or protection, and Golza a 'living fabric' that could grow and change shape depending on the wearers wants and color with the wearer's emotions. One stall even had some small river stones and seashells from Earth, items that had increased in value since the planet's untimely demise. Rarer, and of greater worth were the small collection of books, paper and leather, works of old fiction, if she was not mistaken. Junk to her really. Her kin had long ago abolished all ties with Earth, choosing the freedom of the void. . She pointed to a black one, which to anyone else, would look like an imitation onyx, and a poor one at that. But Rhinn knew what it was. She was possibly the only human who did. She had been blessed with 'the Sight' but not in the way her ancestors had been. She couldn't see the future or read fortunes. But she could do something else. She could see the threads of dark matter space. She could read the lines and follow the paths. Not as good as a Fedorian. But good enough. With some help. ""I'm interested in this crystal. """"Bah, a worthless trinket. Not pretty enough for a lady such as you,"" the Morhawk replied in Basic. . Morhawks didn't have memory in a traditional sense. They stored information and could perform tasks in response to key phrases. Once the task limit was exhausted, their 'brain' atrophied. They were ideal for anyone who wanted to pedal contraband. If caught, Morhawks would never be able to reveal where they came from or who they worked for.After a few minutes, the Morhawk slid a slender, slimey projection forward. Its' arm, she guessed (and hoped). It was not unusual in these types of beings for sex organs to resemble tentacles, and double in function as extra limbs. The dark matter crystal was held in the end of the limb. Hidden under it were some small capsules that contained the Oru, the drug that she used to heighten her 'Sight', allowing her to navigate dark matter space without Fedorian technology. . Now all that was left was hoping Alonzo had found the damned map.The map it turned out had been a fake. Rhinn sat in the Captains chair of the Ghost, trying to clear her mind of frustration and failure. Alonzo, her second, inserted needles into her arms and attached the neural probes that allowed her to control the ship. She waited for the Fedorians to open the dark matter gate for the other waiting ships, then maneuvered the Ghost into the portal. Her ship, aptly named, moved silently, evading the detection of scanners. Even if someone was staring at the ship from a window, they wouldnt see it. For some reason, its body diverted light away from it or around it, making it practically invisible. . But die she had not. Instead, she had stumbled upon the ship. There had only been one occupant on board when she had entered the strange vessel. At first, she had thought the alien passenger dead, body warped and twisted, looking as though it had partially melded with the ship. But it was not dead. The strange being had woken then, grabbing her arm, taking a hold of her in a way that was more than physical.It had used her then, her energy, her life force, somehow to fuel it and power the ship, getting them off the planet and into space.Rhinn hadnt understood what was happening at the time. To be honest, she still didnt understand it fully. She remembered, beyond the fear, a strange sense of awe and euphoria. . She had passed out and by the time she had come to, the alien was dead. And the ship as well. From what she had pieced together, the alien and the ship were both living beings, symbiotically bound. With the death of one, the other had died. Essentially, Rhinn was riding around in a carcass.It was Alonzo who had rigged it, figured out how to make it go, without it being alive and finding her a way to control it. She had come to understand a few things about the ship after being connected to the alien. For starters said ship could travel in dark matter space. So far, the Fedorians were the only ones who had that technology in the Galaxy. Oh, they let others use it for a price, but they hoarded the secret of that technology like a dragon hoarded gold. . Well, at least the living ones could. The third thing she had gleaned was that there were more of them out there, but the question was where? After the encounter, Rhinn had been possessed with a desperate desire to find them. She had told herself that she had merely wanted to capture a living vessel. Imagine what she could do with that! The power, the ability to take away the Fedorian monopoly, and the ability to strike at the heart of her enemies, hard, fast, unseen, like a specter emerging to attack without warning. Yes, that was the reason. Profit. Vengeance. Nothing more.Today was just a minor setback. But Rhinn was patient. There were other leads, other clues to follow. She would wait and search and hope. And in the end, she would get what she wanted. . ",,real

Sensitive meant weak, and weakness meant being unable to take care of myself properly. So, sensitivity became weakness, which led to the realization that I would never be able to handle my life on my own. This caused many fiery rows between my mother and her therapist. During one of these patient therapy sessions, my psychiatrist finally said that there was no such thing as an overly sensitive eye. In fact, it was more like a lack of any sort of existing sexual attraction at all. The doctor then went on to tell me that if I could just stop crying every waking minute for the rest of my life, I could finally stop having this truly miserable life. It was a truly miserable life for me. I had only one blue eyed companion, and he wasnt very good at it. He would immediately pull out his phone and start playing games with my cat. My brown eyes turned red as soon as he started to play with the cat, which caused many fiery rows between us. The fights were so intense that they became an issue in our patient therapy sessions. One day, during one of these sessions, we finally struck gold. We decided to take him on a date. It was supposed to be a romantic evening, but something just felt off about it. For some reason, there was no real attraction or even any non-existent sexual attraction. In fact, both of us seemed to have this immense sexual attraction to each other. .

When I would come home from work, he would immediately pull out his phone and ask me if I wanted to go on a date. This caused many fiery rows between us as we argued about whether or not it was right for me to even be thinking about such things. It took several months of patient therapy sessions before our psychiatrist finally said: You have an immense sexual attraction to both men and women. . That was the day I finally struck gold. My therapist finally said, Youre right Blue Eyed Man. You are going to have a truly miserable life.
I had no choice but to agree with her. I could finally stop crying every waking minute of my life. It wasnt that I did not love him, it was just that he made me feel so much more sensitive. Sensitive meant weak and fragile. Sensitivity became weakness. The only way for me to be able to cope with this is to take care of myself. In order to do that, I needed to focus on what I wanted most in life. To put it simply, I need to get out of my comfort zone. . I finally struck gold.

The crew members were surprised to see such a human figure floating near their ship. In fact, all ten crew members began to suspect that there was something very odd about the stranger found floating near our ship. It was becoming quite rough off the east coast of Africa, and the captain decided to take them to the island for safekeeping. He, a monk who lived in the island. The monk advised Martin that he should not go near the island because it was becoming quite rough. He had already warned Martin to stay away from the island as soon as possible. 'It is too dangerous,' said the monk. 'I am afraid of what might happen if something else happens. I do not want you to get caught up in this treasure hunt,' said Tim, one of the ship's most experienced crew members.

He had already warned Martin about the dangers of being alone in the sea. It was becoming quite rough and he knew that it would be difficult for him to navigate through the rough sea without sinking.

44,"Needless to say this was the strangest job interview I 'd ever had, and it hadn't even started yet. I almost considered not showing up, but as a broke kid with just a bachelor's degree, I couldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. I walked into the lobby of the hotel, feeling awkward as hell, my cheap suit making me feel out of place. I 'd been told to go to the conference room, and of course I didn't know where that was. I was on my way to the front desk to ask when the elevator dinged open, catching my attention. A man stepped out, tall, handsome, stylish suit, and a pair of sleek black sunglasses. He took one look at me and stepped back in surprise. `` Michael? '' he asked. `` Um... yeah. '' `` Goddamn man. '' He said grinning. `` I wasn't expecting you for another... '' He looked down at his watch, his very expensive looking watch. `` Fifteen minutes. That's the right way to start an interview. Follow me. '' I followed him down a series of hallways before finally entering a small conference room. Inside there was an oval shaped table with eight or so chairs surrounding it. `` Alright so, my name's Eli, I 'll be conducting your interview today. '' He said as he pulled out a chair for me. `` You can go ahead and read through this packet, it 'll give you all the basic information of the job you're interviewing for. '' . `` I.. '' he said continuing. `` will go grab a couple bottles of water and... '' he patted himself up and down for a moment. `` a pen. '' He turned to walk out. `` Go ahead and read the packet, I 'll answer any questions you have when I get back. '' `` O..ok. '' I called back as he closed the door behind him. I stared down at the envelope in front of me. It was thick, very thick, what had I gotten myself into? I folded up the metal clip with ease but found that the flap was glued shut, goddamnit. I worked at it for a second, being careful not to rip it. I finally managed to open it and let out a satisfied `` Aha. ``, but instantly there was a loud pop and smoke began to pour out of the envelope. . I shouted as I dropped the envelope on the table. More smoke continued to pour out of it as I backed away to the door. I tried the handle but found that it must have been locked from the outside. I rammed my shoulder against it, calling for help, as the room continued to fill with smoke, I was coughing violently, my lungs burning. I stopped for a moment, trying to catch my breath, when I noticed my vision going blurry. I held my hand up in front of my face and found I could barely make out my individual fingers. `` What the fuck. '' I mumbled as I slowly collapsed to my knees as my vision finally went, feeling delirious. I passed out. I felt something hard pressed around my mouth and nose. There was a steady beep coming from my left. . Slowly I opened my eyes. I was nearly blinded by the white walls and bright lights that surrounded me, but almost instantly I felt my eyes adjust and make it bearable. `` You're finally awake. About time kid. '' I turned my head to the right, finding Eli sitting in a chair against the, facing me. He 'd swapped out the suit for a set of doctor's scrubs, but he still wore the black sunglasses and expensive watch. `` What did you do to me? '' I mumbled. Eli smiled. `` We made you better. '' `` Wha- what do you mean? '' Eli stood up and held a barber style mirror in front of me. `` See for yourself. '' I looked at my reflection and gasped in shock. My eyes. . Gray and metallic throughout, a shiny black dot at the center, as I looked at them I could see them dilate, the center ring visibly rotating. `` My eyes. '' I whispered, barely able to overcome the shock. `` And that's just the tip of the iceberg. '' Eli said, putting down the mirror. `` Of course you probably won't notice the rest of your upgrades until you're back on your feet. '' `` Why did you do this to me? '' I asked, suddenly angry. `` Because, '' Eli said, taking off his glasses. `` We need more people like us . ",,real

I want nothing to do with all of you, just let me go home.Whether you like or not young lady, you are guilty with everyone else and you will have to keep your trap shut about this or you will find yourself in serious trouble. No! You have no right to hold me just let me go, my Aunt and Uncle will be worried about me. You will have to take care of that, Joe replied, passing her the heavy black phone with the frayed cord and well worn dial. Tell them you are with Mikes brother and his family. Tell them you have been snowed in and will be home tomorrow. Do exactly as I say and dont try to get clever either. He said with menace. Leave them out of this, her voice was trembling. How do you know their names?Mike tells me everything. I know all about you, your family, and friends. I even know where your Mother lies in a coma after that road accident that killed your Dad. So sad! So very sad! If you want to protect them, you will follow my orders. Do you understand!Leave my family out of this and how dare you talk about them like that! Just let me go. I am not involved. Mike took me into the jewellery store to buy a present and we were busy choosing a necklace when those horrible men burst into the shop with guns. How was I to know that I was being used as a decoy?Calm down, no need to raise your voice. . You mean to tell me that you had no idea what Mike was involved in. How do you think he could lavish on expensive meals at swanky restaurants and the best seats at West End shows? You two have been swanning around London like there is no tomorrow. You mean to tell me you had no idea where he got the money from.He told me that you were a successful and very influential businessman, that you were his sponsor and that he worked for you in the family business.He was right on that account we are a successful business. London is our playground! It is full of opportunities and even more so now with Hitler dropping bombs all over the place and causing havoc everywhere. You are despicable! You are a common thief How can you take advantage of poor people who are losing everything in the war? I cannot believe it! Was it also your plan to kill an innocent woman! . I am warning you for the last time. You were there you saw what happened to that woman it was an accidentAccident? But they were all carrying guns? All three of them were armed to kill. The shop assistant was shot at point blank range right in front of me, she didnt have a chance.These things happen when people dont listen. She was told to stay down behind the counter but instead tried to be clever and set off the alarm. You are now implicated and if caught will be charged as an accomplice to murder along with the other four. But you do not want to be caught, do you?No! No! this is not fair I had nothing to do with this! You dont seem to understand.I fully understand. . We must come to an understanding if you want to ever go home or see Barry and Mary again. Now you stay here. I have some business to attend to and do not try to leave. There is no way out! Oh by the way dont try anything in your phone call we will be listening.What is going on? How has this happened to me! Please let the nightmare end. Mike and I had lunch and afterwards we walked down Bond street. We were chatting happily and stopped outside the jewellers, we did not go in straight away, we carried on talking as I looked in the window admiring the sparkling display of jewellery. Mike seemed impatient and kept looking at his watch. I remember there was a bread van outside the shop. It was the getaway vehicle. . I knew it was a bread van, it smelt of newly baked bread. What was the name painted on the side of the van? Do I remember? LONDON.. something. Was it LONDON BOYS BAKERY?Mike took my arm and said that he wanted to buy me a Christmas present as he took my hand and led me into the shop. He was being so nice.And then and then!! I must try and calm down and breathe in and out slowly. Breathe in and hold 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 Out. In and hold 1,2,3,..Keep calm and dont panic I will find a way out of this.Here drink this, I am glad to see that you have settled down and made the phone call. . Do you understand? Yes!Good. Now there is nothing to link you and the other four to this robbery and the unfortunate shooting which should never have happened in the first place. It was an accident and there are no witnesses.What about the other shop assistant? She will be able to tell the police everything. No one was wearing a disguise. She could easily give a description of all of us to the police. She will help them with, what do they call it, an identity kit picture. It wont do any good, the other woman is one of us! And now. you are also one of us.What are you saying! I would never want to be involved in your criminal ways.Whether you like it or not you are now deeply involved. . Just let me go.It does not work like that. You will have to make a pledge and to follow orders from now on. Remember you will have to protect Barry and Mary and your poor Mother. I am sure you would want to do that. Are you prepared to take the pledge?Yes, I suppose so.You suppose so! Thats not the answer I was expecting to hear.OK YES!Say it! Pledge that you will be loyal to the Brothers of London. Go on, say it!II pledge that I will be loyal to the Brothers of London.Louder!I pledge I will be loyal to the Brothers of London.If you break the pledge you can say goodbye to Barry and Mary and your Mother as well.

He had been talking to me almost every day since the beginning of the school year. We were inseparable, and today was going to be no different. As soon as I reached Petals bus stop, I knew that this would be our last meeting for a long time. My heart skipped a beat when I saw her walking towards me.

49,"Barrys excitement had reached a breaking level.The short whip he held in his hand dripped blood and skin. As he looked over his shoulder into a mirror, it dawned on him there was a very fine line between religious discipline, flagellation and sexual gratification.He broke that line often.His exercise in repentance had begun somewhat innocently.It was the ninth month of a year that had been a great test for this doggedly devout man.He had been working on clearing himself of character defects and in the process became glaringly aware of several which demanded immediate attention. He grunted as the whip once more tore a strip from his already shredded shoulders. His earliest memories were of reciting the following prayer, while kneeling on a hard surface.His father usually stood over him with a belt in hand and fingers that itched for an opportunity to find fault with his sons delivery.O My God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee. I detest all my sins, because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell.But most of all because they offend Thee, my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love.I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance and to amend my life. Amen.By his teens, Barry had perfected this prayer and the inherent ability to pass off sincerity while he recited it.For the most part it wasnt an act. He was sincere. Sincere in his desperate desire to escape a beating. . Barry had a more difficult time fooling him.This man wore long black robes, lit tall candles, swung incense and performed other rituals which mesmerized and enthralled a rather brainwashed, captivated audience.To further complicate matters, this guy was a bit of a pervert. He had a predilection for young teens. Though he got his jollies from hearing confessions from many, his favourite penitents were boys between the age of 13 and 18. He was well known amongst this crowd of believers and many tried to avoid his confessional cubicle.Barry had diligently kept track of which priests gave confessions on which days and what times.His favourite confessor was Father Ralph, a rather portly jolly fellow who was known for his speedy deliverance. His cursory examination of ones confessed sins, rendered his lineups long.Father Josephs lineups were short. . Many simply gave up the wait and decided to take the risk of going to hell if they diedwithsinson their soul.Barry was terrified of this possibility. As a very young child, he had lived beside a creek. Hed watched this body of water carefully and knew that its waters were plentiful and seemingly endless in abundance. They were born high in the mountains and even during the hottest summer managed to fill the granite banks that determined the meanderings of its journey to the sea.Barry and his siblings were routinely taken to catechism classes where they were dutifully indoctrinated by the nuns that ruled their students. Their beady eyes and sharp pointer stick left little wiggle room for even the most disruptive child.These virginal paragons of faith demanded strict attention and wereswift to use their sticks to ensure compliance. . Imagine that every thousand years, a bird comes and takes one drop of water out of the creek.No matter how often Barry heard this story he would begin to tremble.Sister Assumpta continued, Now after many, many thousands of years, the bird finally takes its last sip of water and miraculously the creek is empty.The children who might not have heard this cautionary tale before, sighed with relief. Maybe hell wouldnt be as bad as they thought. Even with all the burning agonies described by the sterner nuns, there seemed to be an escape clause. . Barrys stomach twisted into knots and he knew, without doubt, that he did NOT want to go to hell. He knew without doubt that eternity was a very long time and that he would do whatever necessary to avoid that punishment.His last confession was taken on a Saturday afternoon.He knew that this was the time Father Ralph was scheduled to do duty in the confessional.What he didnt know was that the good natured priest had been on a bender the night before. Hed been in the church checking for supplies and ended up drinking all the wine set asidefor transubstantiation. This divine ritual rendered the fruit of thevine harmless and actually transformed it into the blood of Jesus Christ.Father Ralph was well known for taking the operation a little too religiously. . He knew that the man would not be emerging till the next day and so made arrangements to alter his own schedule in order to assume Ralphs confessional duties that afternoon.Barry knew none of this. He stood patiently in the line waiting for Father Ralph to hear his list of sins. He entered the cubicle and knew instantly that things were going to head south.It was the smell that first clued him in. Father Joseph smoked and the stale stink of his last drag filled the small enclosure. Worse than the the smoke was another underlying odour that sickened the teens stomach.It was a smell he knew well, and went to great lengths to concealspent semen.Barry was very familiar with this odour and from the age of puberty had been daily releasing  copious amounts of this rich fertilizer. . As he was guided along by the probing pedophile he became aware of the rustling of robes being lifted, zippers being pulled and the stench of stale urine and old semen.He almost gagged as he realized what the man was doing and that he was using Barrys confession as a means of jerking off.The teenager had finally had enough.He rose from the seat, looked the priest square in the eye and shouted, Not this time you sick bastard.He then stormed out of the church and from that day forward, refused to participate in rituals he knew to be depraved and immoral. He knew that he must find a course that would guide him safely through passages that would take him to the end, ready to facewhatever.Came the day Barry stood in the bathroom, whip in hand, blood smeared across the floor. . A quiet voice whispered, Son, I forgive you, go in peace.Barry gasped.He dropped to his knees, closed his eyes and began,O My God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee . ",,real
